  513  0-INFO 


  514  0-INFO Request canceled 

       Cause:
         An I/O request was canceled, usually due to a reset issued by one
         of the programs. 

       Remedy:
         None. 


  515  0-INFO Channel id error 


  516  0-INFO Channel table full 

       Cause:
         There are too many devices and/or files being accessed at once. 

       Remedy:
         Decrease the number of simultaneous device and file open requests. 


  519  0-INFO 


  520  0-INFO I/O request timeout 

       Cause:
         An I/O operation did not complete in the allowable time. 

       Remedy:
         Determine the cause of the device failure and retry it. 


  521  0-INFO EOF detected 

       Cause:
         The referenced file is at its end. 

       Remedy:
         Close the file and reopen it. 


  522  0-INFO 


  523  0-INFO 


  525  0-INFO 


  526  0-INFO 


  527  0-INFO 


  531  0-INFO 


  534  0-INFO No read access 

       Cause:
         A read was attempted on a device or LUN that is for writing only. 

       Remedy:
         Correct the program. 


  535  0-INFO No write access 

       Cause:
         A write was attempted on a device or LUN that is for reading only. 

       Remedy:
         Correct the program. 


  541  0-INFO 


  576  0-INFO File already exists 

       Cause:
         A new file cannot be created because a file by the same name
         already exists. 

       Remedy:
         Change the new file name or delete the existing file. 


  577  0-INFO File does not exist 

       Cause:
         No file by the specified name exists. 

       Remedy:
         Specify only existing files for read, update, delete, rename, etc. 


  578  0-INFO No space for file 

       Cause:
         There is no room on the disk to create the new file. 

       Remedy:
         Delete some old or obsolete files to make room for new ones. 


  579  0-INFO Invalid file name 

       Cause:
         The file name is too long or contains invalid characters. 

       Remedy:
         Specify a correct file name. 


  581  0-INFO File already open 

       Cause:
         The referenced file is already opened by this program. 

       Remedy:
         Correct the program. 


  582  0-INFO Cannot delete file 

       Cause:
         The file cannot be deleted, probably because it is a read-only,
         hidden or system file. 

       Remedy:
         Change the file's attributes if it really should be deleted. 


  583  0-INFO File opened exclusively 

       Cause:
         The file cannot be opened because another program has opened it for
         exclusive access. 

       Remedy:
         Wait until the file has been closed by the other program. 


  584  0-INFO Not a file 


  585  0-INFO Not on same volume 


  587  0-INFO Directory not empty 


  588  0-INFO Name too long 


  589  0-INFO Unsupported file operation 


  590  0-INFO Volume not available 


  591  0-INFO Invalid number of bytes 


  592  0-INFO Illegal name 


  593  0-INFO Cannot delete root 


  594  0-INFO Root directory full 

       Cause:
         The root directory is full. This could either depend to the number
         of files present in the directory or to the lenght of their name. 

       Remedy:
         The use of sub-directories is recommended in order to avoid the
         filling of the main root. Files should be deleted permanently
         otherwise they are still maintained (for being eventually
         undeleted) although not viewed by default; use the Recycle bin menu
         from the File page of the TP or the FilerView/Deleted and
         FilerDelete/Cleanup from TP-INT page or SYS_CALL. 


  595  0-INFO No label 


  596  0-INFO No contiguous space

  601  0-INFO Access beyond end of file 


  602  0-INFO Directory read only 


  603  0-INFO Bad volume format 


  604  0-INFO Illegal cluster number 


  605  0-INFO Open file failed 

       Cause:
         Unable to open the specified file. 

       Remedy:
         Determine the name of the file and why it cannot be opened. 


  606  0-INFO Invalid I/O operation 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to perform some file I/O operation on a device
         that does not support it 

       Remedy:
         Try and determine what operation was being performed and verify
         that it can be performed on this device. 


  607  0-INFO Error during file I/O 

       Cause:
         The file I/O operation generated an error. 

       Remedy:
         Check whether the disk is full or write protected. 


  608  0-INFO Unknown environment variable 

       Cause:
         An environment variable is specified on the file but is unknown. 

       Remedy:
         Check the parameter specified as the environment variable.

 2300  0-INFO Incorrect number of parameters 

       Cause:
         The number of parameters specified when the error was raised is not
         equal to the number defined in the message. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the same number of parameters have been specified. 


 2301  0-INFO Incorrect format of parameters 

       Cause:
         The parameter format for the message is not all string. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure all parameters are off type string.

 2312  0-INFO Null parameter address pointer 


 2313  0-INFO No configuration file specified 

       Cause:
         The configuration file name was empty (contained only the
         terminating character).  All configuration filenames must begin
         with an alphabetic character and consist of only alphanumeric
         characters or the underscore character ('_'). 

       Remedy:
         Make sure all configuration filenames follow the format described
         above. 


 2314  0-INFO No default configuration file specified 


 2315  0-INFO No section name specified 


 2316  0-INFO No module ID specified 


 2317  0-INFO Parameter %s in schema has unknown type code 


 2318  0-INFO Parameter %s not found in schema 


 2319  0-INFO Parameter <ParamName> not found in configuration file 

       Cause:
         The parameter was not found in the configuration file. 

       Remedy:
         Some configuration parameters must exist in the configuration file.
         Check the documentation of the parameter and add it to the proper
         configuration file. 


 2320  0-INFO Module ID <ModuleId> not found in tmc.cfg 

       Cause:
         The module id was not found in tmc.cfg.  Each module must have a
         section in this file which describes its particular configuration
         (configuration filename, executable filename, module id, etc.). 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the tmc.cfg file has the module id specified in one of
         the sections. 


 2321  0-INFO Section <ConfigSection> not found in configuration file 

       Cause:
         The section was not found in the configuration file. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the configuration file being read has the proper section
         names and parameters in those sections. 


 2322  0-INFO Unexpected token found in configuration file 

       Cause:
         An unexpected token was found while reading the configuration file.
         This is caused by a syntax error in the file (like too many
         elements of an array, etc.). 

       Remedy:
         This is usually caused by the wrong number of elements in an array.
         Check all arrays first then check the syntax of the other elements
         of the configuration file. 


 2323  0-INFO Value for parameter <ParamName> is out of range 

       Cause:
         The value for the parameter in the configuration file is out of the
         valid range. 

       Remedy:
         Check the parameter documentation and make sure the value is within
         the allowed range. 


 2324  0-INFO Default value for parameter %s in schema is out of range 


 2325  0-INFO Module parameters out of range 

       Cause:
         The parameters for a module are out of range.  Either the module ID
         is out of range or the platform identifier is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Consult the documentation for these parameters and correct the
         configuration file. 


 2326  0-INFO Parameter %s in schema has invalid (zero) string size 


 2327  0-INFO Error scanning for next token in configuration file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred scanning for the next token in the configuration
         file. 

       Remedy:
         Check the parameter and value format for the entries of the
         configuration file. 


 2328  0-INFO Error closing configuration file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred closing the configuration file. 

       Remedy:
         Note all circumstances causing the error and contact COMAU
         (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2329  0-INFO Error reading from configuration file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred reading from the configuration file. 

       Remedy:
         Note all circumstances causing the error and contact COMAU
         (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2330  0-INFO Parameter <ParamName> doesn't have enough elements 

       Cause:
         The array parameter does not have enough elements. 

       Remedy:
         Check the documentation for the parameter and correct the
         configuration file. 


 2331  0-INFO Parameter <ParamName> has an invalid value 

       Cause:
         The parameter has an invalid value (integer value specified for a
         string type parameter, etc.). 

       Remedy:
         Consult the documentation for the parameter and correct the
         configuration file. 


 2332  0-INFO Fatal error reading configuration file 

       Cause:
         A fatal error was detected reading the configuration file.  Check
         the previous error for more specific information about the cause of
         the error. 

       Remedy:
         Check the previous errors and make corrections to the configuration
         file. 


 2333  0-INFO Invalid event type passed to ibfm_GetEventDest 

       Cause:
         An invalid event type value was passed to the functions
         ibfm_GBetEventDest. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the event type argument in the call to ibfm_GBetEventDest. 


 2334  0-INFO The Controllers key does not exist in the system registry 

       Cause:
         The software is not properly installed. 

       Remedy:
         Reinstall the software from the install disks. 


 2335  0-INFO The controller is not registered 

       Cause:
         The controller being connected is not registered with the PC.  This
         can happen if the software is not properly installed or the
         controller has not yet checked in with the PC. 

       Remedy:
         Properly install the software.  If the problem still exists, call
         customer support. 


 2336  0-INFO Controller network address not specified 

       Cause:
         The network address of the controller is not registered.  This can
         happen if the software is not properly installed or the controller
         has not yet checked in with the PC. 

       Remedy:
         Properly install the software.  If the problem still exists, call
         customer support. 


 2337  0-INFO Invalid controller network address 

       Cause:
         The controller network address is not valid. 

       Remedy:
         Note all circumstances causing the error and contact COMAU
         (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2338  0-INFO Last controller not specified 

       Cause:
         The last controller connected to was not specified.  This can
         happen if the software is not properly installed or the controller
         has not yet checked in with the PC. 

       Remedy:
         If the application allows, connect to a controller via the Connect
         menu. If the application does not allow you to connect, contact
         COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2339  0-INFO Application not registered 

       Cause:
         The application is not registered.  This can happen if the software
         is not properly installed or the applications version is not
         correct. 

       Remedy:
         Properly install the software.  If the problem still exists,
         contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2340  0-INFO Error writing to configuration file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred while writing to the configuration file. 

       Remedy:
         Check available disk space. Contact COMAU
         (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2341  0-INFO Error deleting old configuration file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred while replacing to the configuration file. 

       Remedy:
         Check file attributes on configuration file. Contact COMAU
         (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2342  0-INFO Error replacing configuration file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred while replacing the old configuration file with
         the new one. 

       Remedy:
         Contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


 2343  0-INFO Parameter <ParamName> is required therefore does not need a
       default 

       Cause:
         The parameter's Scope flag in the schema indicates that it is
         required in the config file (Scope's 3rd bit is "1").  Therefore,
         the default value in the schema is never used.  Instead, a value is
         always read from the config file. 

       Remedy:
         The default value should be replaced by a NULL or the 3rd bit of
         the Scope flag should be set to "0". 


 2344  0-INFO Parameter <ParamName> not found in section <SectionName> of
       configuration file <FileName> 

       Cause:
         Some configuration parameters must exist in the configuration file.
         This error occurs when one of these parameters was not found in the
         configuration file.  The parameter name, the section name, and file
         name are supplied so you know where the parameter belongs. 

       Remedy:
         Check the documentation of the parameter and add it to the proper
         configuration file in the proper section. 


 2345  0-INFO Previous error occurred on line <LineNumber> in section
       <SectionName> of configuration file <FileName> 

       Cause:
         This error simply reports additional information for the previously
         reported error related to the configuration files.  The information
         provided includes the line number, the section name, and file name
         so you know where the error was detected. 

       Remedy:
         Check the previously reported error and use the information in this
         error to help you locate the problem.

 8193  2-WARNING <string> 

       Cause:
         This message, concerning the handling of devices on the Powerlink
         network, either highlights a critical aspect or represents an
         informational. If strings similar to SL1.IF2.STxxx (xxx is a
         number) are present, it is needed to focus the attention on
         Powerlink. The device can be an ACOPOS, a Bus Coupler or a Safe
         Logic and the problem could be its lack on the Powerlink, although
         correctly configured. In case 'epl_any' string is indicated, the
         subject is an ACOPOS module. Please note that the ACOPOS address on
         rotational commutators is expressed in hexadecimal notation, while
         the address 'xxx' is expressed in decimal notation. The system also
         reports the informational on the performed updates on the
         interested devices. For example: "Module (epl_any) not found on
         Path: SL1.IF2.ST19", means that the ACOPOS device at address 19 in
         decimal is absent on the Powerlink network. 

       Remedy:
         Please follow the chain of connections up to the device which
         address is the reported one.

       Cause:
         This error occurs when one or more devices are absent on the
         Powerlink network. 

       Remedy:
         Please check if other messages are previously shown which could
         help in identifying the device which is absent on the Powerlink
         network. The device and its address are indicated by strings
         similar to SL1.IF2.STxxx, where xxx is the address.

 8197  11-DRIVE OFF Create Device failure. Interface <path_string> Error
       <error> 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when one or more devices are absent on the
         Powerlink network. The indicated interface, like 'SL1.IF2',
         identifies the main Powerlink network; 'SL2.IF1' identifies the
         network of the Powerlink annex. 

       Remedy:
         Please check if other messages are previously shown which could
         help in identifying the device which is absent on the Powerlink
         network. The device and its address are indicated by strings
         similar to SL1.IF2.STxxx, where xxx is the address.

 8201  11-DRIVE OFF Open Device failure. Interface <path_string> Cyclic
       <cyclic_string> Code <code_error> 

       Cause:
         One or more devices could be absent on the Powerlink network.
         Please check if other messages are previously shown which could
         help in identifying the device which is absent on the Powerlink
         network. In this situation the Powerlink network does not properly
         work. If the Cyclic parameter reports 'Y', it means that the
         scanning of the devices on the Powerlink network has not been
         activated. The indicated interface, like 'SL1.IF2' for the main
         Powerlink or 'SL2.IF1' for the Powerlink annex, identifies the
         Powerlink network which could not be activated. 

       Remedy:
         Please check that all devices configured on the Powerlink network
         are physically connected. Please check if other messages are
         previously shown which could help in identifying the device which
         is absent on the Powerlink network. The device and its address are
         indicated by strings similar to SL1.IF2.STxxx, where xxx is the
         address.

11292  0-INFO Local RAM error 


11293  0-INFO Shared RAM error 


11294  0-INFO Power failure 

       Cause:
         The request failed due to a power failure.  This message usually
         appears after the controller has restarted when power returns. 

       Remedy:
         None. 


11295  0-INFO 


11296  0-INFO Request aborted 

       Cause:
         The requested operation was aborted due to some other error. 

       Remedy:
         Determine the actual cause of the failure. 


11297  0-INFO No response from CPU 

       Cause:
         The diagnostic that checks for correct communication among the
         multiple CPUs has detected a failure.  This may halt the system. 

       Remedy:
         Restart the controller and check the startup diagnostics for more
         information. 


11298  0-INFO Pipe full 

       Cause:
         The pipe being written to is full. 

       Remedy:
         Either increase the size of the pipe or don't write so much without
         reading from it. 


11299  0-INFO Pipe empty 

       Cause:
         There is no data in the pipe. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that data has been written to the pipe. 


11300  0-INFO 


11301  0-INFO 


11302  0-INFO 


11303  0-INFO 


11304  0-INFO 


11305  0-INFO 


11306  0-INFO No pipe resources 

       Cause:
         If writing to a pipe, this indicates that the pipe already contains
         messages that have not yet been delivered and there is no room to
         write any more messages. If reading, this means there is already
         one or more programs waiting to read messages from the pipe and
         this request cannot be carried out. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the program that is on the other end of the pipe is
         active and is reading or writing data correctly. The input/output
         operation can also be retried after a time delay period. It is not
         recommended to repeatedly retry this operation, since this could
         cause the program to go into an indefinite loop. 


11307  0-INFO 


11308  0-INFO Not all files transferred 

       Cause:
         During a transfer of multiple files to the controller, one or more
         of the files could not be read because the file already exists on
         the controller and is a read-only or system file. 

       Remedy:
         Check the other messages that were displayed during the transfer to
         see which files were not transferred. If it is necessary to
         retransfer it, change its attributes first. 


11309  0-INFO PC file transfer request failed 

       Cause:
         A file transfer between the controller and the attached PC failed
         to complete successfully. 

       Remedy:
         Check the other messages that were displayed during the transfer to
         see if any specific error was detected. Retry the operation. 


11310  0-INFO PC file transfer record sequence error 

       Cause:
         A file transfer between the controller and the attached PC failed
         to complete successfully. 

       Remedy:
         Check the other messages that were displayed during the transfer to
         see if any specific error was detected. Retry the operation. 


11311  0-INFO PC file transfer protocol error 

       Cause:
         A file transfer between the controller and the attached PC failed
         to complete successfully. 

       Remedy:
         Check the other messages that were displayed during the transfer to
         see if any specific error was detected. Retry the operation. 


11312  0-INFO File not found on PC 

       Cause:
         A file transfer between the controller and the attached PC failed
         because the requested file was not found on the PC. 

       Remedy:
         Move the file to the correct directory on the PC and make sure that
         it is available. 


11313  0-INFO File can not be created on PC 

       Cause:
         The file cannot be transferred from the controller to the PC
         because it cannot be created on the PC. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the default directory is valid on the PC. If a file
         of the same name exists on the PC, make sure that it is not set to
         read-only. 


11314  0-INFO File can not be deleted on PC 

       Cause:
         A file delete request from the controller to the PC cannot be
         completed. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the requested file on the PC is not set to
         read-only. 


11315  0-INFO File can not be renamed on PC 

       Cause:
         A file rename request from the controller to the PC cannot be
         completed. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the requested file on the PC is not set to
         read-only. 


11316  0-INFO Error reading or writing file on PC 

       Cause:
         A fatal error was encountered on the PC while reading or writing
         the requested file. 

       Remedy:
         Check to see if the requested file on the PC is valid, and that the
         disk does not have any errors. 


11317  0-INFO PC disk is full 

       Cause:
         A file cannot be transferred from the controller to the PC because
         the PC's disk is full. 

       Remedy:
         Delete some files on the PC to make room for the new files. 


11318  0-INFO PC file transfer communications error 

       Cause:
         A file tranfer failed due to a communications error between the CRC
         and the PC.

13339  10-DRIVE OFF DPRO timeout 

       Cause:
         A timeout occurred during the communication between the robot
         controller and the programming terminal. Possible causes:
         disconnection or restart of the terminal; terminal CPU overload
         (due, for example, to VP2 or JAVA resources). 

       Remedy:
         If the terminal has been disconnected or restarted (via further
         keys), this error is justified and should be ignored by the user.
         If the problem periodically occurs and always under the same
         conditions (for example running the same programs), try to optimize
         the use of VP2 or JAVA programs (if present). Check the hardware
         connections (TP cable or network cable which connects the docking
         station with the CPU). If the problem persists, please contact
         COMAU(service.robotics@comau.com).

       Cause:
         An ethernet connection problem occurred in the communication
         between programming unit and controller. 

       Remedy:
         If the problem persist always in the same conditions (for example
         always with the same running programs), check that no PDL2 programs
         are overloading the CPU (for example programs with cycle loops

         operation of the robot). 

       Remedy:
         Please check the ethernet connection between the TP and the APC
         (connector positioned in the base of the robot, network cable
         inside the cabinet, etc...). If the problem persists , try to
         exchange this TP with another which never showed the problem, in
         order to understand if the problem is related to the TP or to the
         controller. If the system is equipped with a wireless cabinet, this

       Cause:
         A feature used on the statement being translated is not yet
         implemented. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure proper software is loaded on the system.  It may be
         necessary to rework the program to avoid using the unimplemented
         feature.

17412  0-INFO Token stack overflow 


17413  0-INFO Ran out of local memory 

       Cause:
         The translation process ran out of free heap memory. 

       Remedy:
         There is a fixed amount of heap memory and it can't be changed by
         the user. 


17414  0-INFO Invalid data type used in an expression 

       Cause:
         An operand is an invalid data type.  For example, the NOT operator
         can only be applied on INTEGER and BOOLEAN operands.  An operand of
         any other data type will cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the operand(s) used in the expression. 


17415  0-INFO String value too long 

       Cause:
         A STRING literal exceeds the maximum length of 254. 

       Remedy:
         Use multiple shorter strings instead of one long string in the
         program. 


17416  0-INFO Invalid ASCII specification in a string value 

       Cause:
         An invalid ASCII specification has been detected in a STRING
         literal. This means a non-digit character is used in the 
nn
         notation or the number specified is not a valid ASCII character
         code.  For example, 'test 12a error' will cause this error since
         '12a' is not a valid 3 digit number. 

       Remedy:
         Use a proper 3 digit number in the 
nn notation of a STRING
         literal. 


17417  0-INFO BOOLEAN expression expected 

       Cause:
         The expression must result in a BOOLEAN value.  For example, "IF 5
         THEN" will cause this error since the expression for an IF
         statement must result in a BOOLEAN value. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the expression so it results in a BOOLEAN value. 


17418  0-INFO INTEGER expression expected 

       Cause:
         The expression must result in an INTEGER value.  For example "DELAY
         5.6" will cause this error since the expression for a DELAY
         statement must result in an INTEGER value. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the expression so it results in an INTEGER value. 


17419  0-INFO REAL expression expected 

       Cause:
         The expression must result in a REAL value.  If the expression
         results in an INTEGER value, it will be converted to a REAL
         automatically. However, if the expression results in any other data
         type, this error will be detected.  For example, "MOVE AWAY TRUE"
         will cause this error since the value of the expression is not
         INTEGER or REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the expression so it results in a REAL value. 


17420  0-INFO VECTOR expression expected 

       Cause:
         The expression must result in a VECTOR value.  For example, "MOVE
         RELATIVE 5 IN BASE" will cause this error since 5 is not a valid
         VECTOR value. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the expression so it results in a VECTOR value. 


17421  0-INFO Positional typed expression expected 

       Cause:
         The expression must result in a POSITION, JOINTPOS, or XTNDPOS
         value. For example, "MOVE TO 6" will cause this error since the
         destination expression does not result in a POSITION, JOINTPOS, or
         XTNDPOS value. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the expression so it results in a POSITION, JOINTPOS, or
         XTNDPOS value. 


17422  0-INFO Invalid INTEGER operator 

       Cause:
         The operator cannot be used with INTEGER operands. For example, the
         "@" operator cannot have INTEGER operands. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper operands and operators are specified in the
         expression. 


17423  0-INFO Invalid REAL operator 

       Cause:
         The operator cannot be used with REAL operands. For example, the
         "@" operator cannot have REAL operands. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper operands and operators are specified in the
         expression. 


17424  0-INFO Invalid BOOLEAN operator 

       Cause:
         The operator cannot be used with BOOLEAN operands. For example, the
         "+" operator cannot have BOOLEAN operands. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper operands and operators are specified in the
         expression. 


17425  0-INFO Invalid STRING operator 

       Cause:
         The operator cannot be used with STRING operands. For example, the
         "+" operator cannot have STRING operands. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper operands and operators are specified in the
         expression. 


17426  0-INFO Invalid VECTOR operator 

       Cause:
         The operator cannot be used with VECTOR operands. For example, the
         "DIV" operator cannot have VECTOR operands. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper operands and operators are specified in the
         expression. 


17427  0-INFO Illegal statement context 

       Cause:
         A statement is used in the program in an invalid statement context.
         For example, all variable declarations must be in a VAR section and
         cannot appear between the BEGIN and END of the program.  If a VAR
         declaration is between the BEGIN and END this error will be
         detected. 

       Remedy:
         Move the statement to the proper context. 


17428  0-INFO Fields cannot be user-defined data types 

       Cause:
         A field of a record or node definition cannot be a record or node
         type. 

       Remedy:
         Rework the program to get around the requirement of having a field
         be a record or node type. 


17429  0-INFO Input file <file_name> not found 

       Cause:
         The file being translated does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the file name was properly entered. 


17430  0-INFO Error reading the input file 

       Cause:
         The FILER TRANSLATE command detected an error while reading the
         file being translated. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


17431  0-INFO Error closing the input file 

       Cause:
         The FILER TRANSLATE command detected an error while closing the
         file being translated. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


17432  0-INFO 


17433  0-INFO Identifier <id> undefined 

       Cause:
         An identifier is used in the statement which has not yet been
         declared. All identifiers used in a PDL2 program must be declared
         before any references to the identifiers are declared. 

       Remedy:
         Check spelling of the identifier to be sure it is the proper
         identifier to be used.  If so, add a proper declaration for the
         identifier. 


17434  0-INFO Id <id> must be an INTEGER constant 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when an identifier is used as the size of a
         STRING, ARRAY dimension, arm number, etc. and the identifier is not
         an INTEGER user-defined constant.  Only INTEGER user-defined
         constant identifiers can be used.  The following example would
         cause this error since "myvar" is a variable and not a user-defined
         constant. - -  VAR -    myvar : INTEGER -    s : STRING[myvar]  --
         Error since myvar is a variable 

       Remedy:
         Change the reference to a valid INTEGER user-defined constant or an
         INTEGER literal. 


17435  0-INFO Invalid STRING size 

       Cause:
         An invalid size was specified in a STRING declaration.  The size
         must be greater than 0 and less than the maximum size for a STRING
         which is 254.  For example, "VAR s : STRING[356]" would cause this
         error since 356 is too large. 

       Remedy:
         Change the size of the STRING to be in the range 1..254. 


17436  0-INFO Program name too long 

       Cause:
         The length of the specified program name is greater than 8. 

       Remedy:
         Shorten the length of the program name. 


17437  0-INFO Program identifier expected 

       Cause:
         A program identifier is expected but the translation process
         detected some other kind of identifier or literal.  For example, if
         "myvar" is declared as a variable, the "PAUSE myvar" statement
         would cause this error since "myvar" is not a program identifier. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the identifier referenced to be a program identifier. 


17438  0-INFO Identifier <id> previously declared 

       Cause:
         A user-defined identifier name can only be used once within the
         same scope.  For example, if the main program declares "myvar" as a
         variable, the name "myvar" cannot be used as the name of a routine,
         user-defined constant, user-defined type, or another variable
         declared in the main program. 

       Remedy:
         Choose a different name. 


17439  0-INFO Identifier not a record structure 

       Cause:
         A user-defined record type identifier is expected but the
         translation process detected some other kind of identifier.  The
         following example would cause this error since "myvar" is not a
         user-defined RECORD type identifier. - -  VAR -    myvar : INTEGER
         -    recvar : myvar  -- Error since myvar is a variable 

       Remedy:
         Fix the identifier referenced to be a user-defined record type
         identifier. 


17440  0-INFO Invalid target in an assignment statement 

       Cause:
         This error occurs due to an invalid left operand of the assignment
         statement.  The left operand must be a valid variable, parameter,
         or local variable reference. For example, "5 := a" will cause this
         error since "5" is not a valid variable identifier reference. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the left operand of the assignment statement to be a valid
         variable, parameter, or local variable reference. 


17441  0-INFO Data type mismatch in assignment statement 

       Cause:
         The data type of the right operand of an assignment statement is
         not compatible with the left operand variable reference.  The left
         and right operands must be of the exact same data type with the
         exception that the right operand can be INTEGER if the left is
         REAL.  The following example will cause this error to occur since
         6.7 is REAL and incompatible with an INTEGER variable. - -  VAR -  
         myvar : INTEGER -    yourvar : REAL -  . . . -  BEGIN -    -- Valid
         statement (can assign INTEGER to REAL) -    yourvar := myvar - -   
         -- Invalid statement (can't assign REAL to INTEGER) -    myvar :=
         6.7 

       Remedy:
         Fix the assignment statement so the operands are compatible data
         types. 


17442  0-INFO Assignment not permitted on variables of this type 

       Cause:
         Not all variables can be assigned a value using the assignment
         statement.  This error is the result of trying to perform an
         assignment to a variable whose data type is not permitted.  For
         example, if "myvar" is declared as a SEMAPHORE variable, it cannot
         be used as the left operand in the assignment statement ("myvar :=
         ..."). 


17443  0-INFO Ran out of memory 

       Cause:
         The translation process ran out of free memory. 

       Remedy:
         Erase all unnecessary programs and variables from memory and
         retranslate.  If the error was detected while editing a program,
         suspend from the editor to perform the erasing so previous changes
         to the program are not lost. 


17444  0-INFO Implicitly declaring variable <var_id> 

       Cause:
         In some cases, the data type information of an undeclared
         identifier can be determined by the context of its usage.  In these
         cases, the translation process will automatically insert a variable
         declaration for the identifier in the program.  This warning is
         given each time an identifier is implicitly declared in the
         program.  For example, if "myvar" is not declared in the program,
         the "myvar := 0" statement will produce this warning and a
         declaration for "myvar" will be added which declares "myvar" to be
         an INTEGER variable. 

       Remedy:
         This is just a warning but if a typing mistake was made and the
         translation process declared a new variable, the typing mistake
         should be fixed and then the added declaration should be deleted. 


17445  0-INFO Invalid ARRAY size 

       Cause:
         An invalid size was specified in an ARRAY declaration.  The size
         must be greater than 0 and less than the maximum size for an ARRAY
         dimension which is 65535.  The following example would cause this
         error since 66666 is too large. - -  VAR ari : ARRAY[66666] OF
         INTEGER 

       Remedy:
         Change the size of the ARRAY dimension to be in the range 1..65535. 


17446  0-INFO Wrong id after END - replacing with <id> 

       Cause:
         This is detected when the identifier following the END does not
         match the name of the routine or program being ended.  This is just
         a warning and the translation process will automatically replace
         the improper identifier with the proper routine or program
         identifier. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17447  0-INFO Inserting missing CONST keyword 

       Cause:
         Each new user-defined constant section must begin with the CONST
         keyword.  This warning is given if the translation process has to
         automatically add the keyword. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17448  0-INFO Inserting missing VAR keyword 

       Cause:
         Each new variable declaration section must begin with the VAR
         keyword.  This warning is given if the translation process has to
         automatically add the keyword. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17449  0-INFO Arrays do not have the same dimensions 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when an assignment is performed between two
         ARRAYs and the ARRAYs do not have the same number of dimensions. 
         The assignment statement in the following example would cause this
         error since "ar1" is only one dimensional but "ar2" is two
         dimensional. - -  VAR -    ar1 : ARRAY[10] OF INTEGER -    ar2 :
         ARRAY[10, 20] OF INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -    ar1 := ar2  --
         Error due to dimension mismatch 

       Remedy:
         Make sure both ARRAYs have the same number of dimensions. 


17451  0-INFO Invalid identifier class 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when an identifier is used in the wrong
         context.  For example, if "mytype" is declared as a RECORD in the
         TYPE section, "SQRT(mytype)" would cause this error because mytype
         is a TYPE and not a variable. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the identifier being used is of the proper classification
         for the context. 


17452  0-INFO Identifier cannot be indexed or fielded 

       Cause:
         Only ARRAY, JOINTPOS, and a PATH node table can be indexed.  Only
         records and PATH nodes can be fielded.  This error is detected when
         an identifier other than one of these types is indexed or fielded. 
         For example, if "myvar" is declared as an INTEGER variable,
         "myvar[4]" would generate this error.  Likewise, "myvar.fld" would
         also generate this error. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the identifier being indexed is an ARRAY, JOINTPOS, or
         PATH node table before using the [] notation.  Make sure the
         identifier is a record or PATH node before using the field (.)
         notation. 


17453  0-INFO Invalid indexing of an identifier 

       Cause:
         If a variable is a one-dimensional ARRAY, it can only be indexed
         using one index value.  However, if the variable is a
         two-dimensional ARRAY, it can only be indexed using two index
         values.  This error is detected when only one index value is
         specified for a two-dimensional ARRAY or two index values are
         specified for a one-dimensional ARRAY. - -  VAR -    ar1 :
         ARRAY[10] OF INTEGER -    ar2 : ARRAY[10, 20] OF INTEGER -  . . . -
         BEGIN -    ar1[2, 4] := 56  -- Error since ar1 is one-dimensional -
         ar2[5] := 23     -- Error since ar2 is two-dimensional 

       Remedy:
         Use the proper number of index values when indexing an ARRAY
         variable. 


17454  0-INFO Indirizzo non corretto per codice di espressione 


17455  0-INFO Invalid indexing of a JOINTPOS 

       Cause:
         A JOINTPOS variable can be indexed using one index value only. 
         This error is detected when two index values are specified.  For
         example, if "myvar" is declared as a JOINTPOS variable, the
         "myvar[5, 7]" reference will cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Use only one index value for indexing a JOINTPOS variable. 


17456  0-INFO Default arm attribute already specified 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when multiple default arm attributes are
         specified on the PROGRAM statement. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper default arm attribute and delete the other(s). 


17457  0-INFO Invalid value specified for arm attr 

       Cause:
         An invalid arm number is specified in the default arm attribute of
         the PROGRAM statement.  The arm number must be greater than 0 and
         less than 5. 

       Remedy:
         Choose a valid arm number. 


17458  0-INFO Program type attribute already specified 

       Cause:
         Multiple program type attributes are specified on the PROGRAM
         statement.  There can be only one of the HOLD, NOHOLD attributes
         specified on the PROGRAM statement. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper program type attribute and delete the other(s). 


17459  0-INFO Priority attribute already specified 

       Cause:
         The priority attribute can only be specified once on the PROGRAM
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper priority and delete the other(s). 


17460  0-INFO Invalid value specification for priority attribute 

       Cause:
         An invalid priority is specified in the priority attribute of the
         PROGRAM statement.  The priority must be greater than 0 and less
         than 4. 

       Remedy:
         Choose a valid priority value. 


17461  0-INFO Stack size attribute already specified 

       Cause:
         The stack size attribute can only be specified once on the PROGRAM
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper stack size attribute and delete the other(s). 


17462  0-INFO Invalid value specification for stack size attribute 

       Cause:
         An invalid stack size is specified in the stack size attribute of
         the PROGRAM statement.  The stack size must be greater than -1 and
         less than 65535. 

       Remedy:
         Choose a valid stack size. 


17463  0-INFO Invalid or missing program header 

       Cause:
         The PROGRAM statement is invalid or not contained in the file being
         translated.  The translation process will stop since a program is
         not valid without a PROGRAM statement. 

       Remedy:
         Edit the file being translated and fix/add the PROGRAM statement. 


17464  0-INFO Error opening output file 

       Cause:
         The .COD file cannot be opened.  This is generally due to a full
         RAM disk. 

       Remedy:
         Erase all unnecessary files and issue the FILER TRANSLATE command
         again.  If this error is detected while editing, suspend the editor
         and erase the unnecessary files.  Then return to the editor and
         issue the SAVE command so that the modifications to the program are
         not lost. 


17465  0-INFO Not enough disk space for output file 

       Cause:
         The .COD file could not be closed properly.  This error is usually
         caused by not having enough disk space for the file. 

       Remedy:
         Erase all unnecessary files and issue the FILER TRANSLATE command
         again.  If this error is detected while editing, suspend the editor
         and erase the unnecessary files.  Then return to the editor and
         issue the SAVE command so that the modifications to the program are
         not lost. 


17466  0-INFO Label <label_id> is undefined 

       Cause:
         A label is used in a GOTO statement but is not actually used to
         label a line of code.  This error is detected when the program is
         saved and loaded as well as when the editor checks for errors. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the labels used in the GOTO statements are properly
         typed. If so, add the label to the appropriate line so that it gets
         defined. 


17467  0-INFO INTEGER LUN expected 

       Cause:
         An INTEGER LUN identifier is expected in a FILE statement.  The
         translation process detected some other type of identifier.  The
         following example would cause this error since "myvar" is not a
         valid INTEGER LUN. - -  VAR myvar : VECTOR -  . . . -  BEGIN -   
         -- Error since myvar is not an INTEGER variable -    CLOSE FILE
         myvar 

       Remedy:
         Change the LUN to a valid INTEGER variable reference. 


17468  0-INFO Invalid assignment action 

       Cause:
         An invalid assignment action is detected.  This is due to an
         expression being used for the right operand instead of a single
         variable reference, literal, or constant identifier reference.  The
         following example will cause this error since the right operand of
         the assignment action is an expression. - -  VAR a, i : INTEGER - 
         . . . -  BEGIN -    CONDITION[3]: -      WHEN $DIN[4]+ DO -       
         -- Error since expression is used in the action -        a := 4 * i
         -      . . . -    ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Fix the right operand so that it is a single variable reference, a
         literal, or a constant identifier reference. 


17469  0-INFO Invalid arm number 

       Cause:
         An invalid arm number has been specified.  Arm numbers must be
         greater than 0 and less than 5.  This error is detected for arm
         specifications in the declaration section of a program. 

       Remedy:
         Use a valid arm number in the range 1..32. 


17470  0-INFO Routine identifier expected 

       Cause:
         Only a routine identifier can be used in a routine call.  This
         error is detected when an identifier is used in a routine call that
         is not declared as a routine.  The following example would cause
         this error since "myvar" is not a routine. - -  VAR myvar : INTEGER
         -  . . . -  BEGIN -    -- Error since myvar is not a ROUTINE -   
         myvar(4, i, 8.6) 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper identifier is used in the routine call.  If
         undefined, add a declaration for the routine. 


17471  0-INFO Too many arguments 

       Cause:
         Too many arguments are specified in a routine call.  The following
         example would cause this error since 3 arguments are specified in
         the routine call but the routine is declared as having only 2
         parameters. - -  ROUTINE myrout(i, j : INTEGER) EXPORTED FROM utils
         -  . . . -  BEGIN -    myrout(2, 4, 6)   -- Error since too many
         arguments 

       Remedy:
         Remove the incorrect arguments from the routine call.  Verify the
         routine call against the routine declaration. 


17472  0-INFO Not enough arguments 

       Cause:
         Not enough arguments are specified in a routine call. The following
         example would cause this error since 1 argument is specified in the
         routine call but the routine is declared as having 2 parameters. -
         -  ROUTINE myrout(i, j : INTEGER) EXPORTED FROM utils -  . . . - 
         BEGIN -    myrout(26)   -- Error since not enough arguments 

       Remedy:
         Add missing arguments to the routine call.  Verify the routine call
         against the routine declaration. 


17473  0-INFO Argument data type doesn't match the parameter 

       Cause:
         The data type of an argument doesn't match the declaration of the
         corresponding parameter.  The data types of the argument and its
         corresponding parameter must be compatible.  This means they must
         be exactly the same type with the exception that an INTEGER
         argument can be passed by value to a REAL parameter.  The following
         example would cause this error since the data type of the argument
         is BOOLEAN and is not compatible with the INTEGER parameter
         declaration. - -  ROUTINE myrout(i : INTEGER) EXPORTED FROM utils -
         . . . -  BEGIN -    -- Error since the parameter is INTEGER -    --
         but the argument is BOOLEAN -    myrout(TRUE) 

       Remedy:
         Fix the routine call to be sure corresponding arguments and
         parameters are compatible. Verify the routine call against the
         routine declaration. 


17474  0-INFO Mismatch in ARRAY dim of argument 

       Cause:
         The number of dimensions of an ARRAY argument must be equal to the
         number of dimensions of the corresponding ARRAY parameter.  The
         following example will cause this error since we cannot pass a 1
         dimensional ARRAY argument to a 2 dimensional ARRAY parameter. - - 
         VAR myvar : ARRAY[5] OF INTEGER -  . . . -  ROUTINE myrout(ai :
         ARRAY[*, *] OF INTEGER) -  BEGIN -  . . . -  END myrout -  . . . - 
         BEGIN -    -- Error since param is 2 dim and argument is 1 dim -   
         myrout(myvar) 

       Remedy:
         Fix the routine call to be sure corresponding ARRAY arguments and
         parameters have the same number of dimensions. Verify the routine
         call against the routine declaration. 


17475  0-INFO Address argument expected 

       Cause:
         The built-in routine being called expects an argument to be passed
         by reference.  This means the argument must be a valid variable,
         parameter, or local variable reference.  For example, the
         VAR_UNINIT function expects the argument to be a variable reference
         which means the "VAR_UNINIT(3)" routine call will cause this error
         since 3 is not a valid variable reference. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the argument so it is passed by reference. 


17476  0-INFO Routine <rout_id> is not a function 

       Cause:
         Only a function routine can be invoked in an expression.  A
         procedure routine must be called as a single statement.  The
         following example will cause this error since "myrout" is a
         procedure routine. - -  VAR myvar : INTEGER -  . . . -  ROUTINE
         myrout(i : INTEGER) EXPORTED FROM utils -  . . . -  BEGIN -    --
         Error since myrout is not a function -    myvar:= myrout(5) 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper routine is being called.  If it is a
         procedure, then put the call in the appropriate statement form. 


17477  0-INFO Routine <rout_id> is not a procedure 

       Cause:
         Only a procedure routine can be invoked as a single statement.  A
         function routine must be called in an expression.  The following
         example will cause this error since "myrout" is a function routine.
         - -  ROUTINE myrt(i : INTEGER) : REAL EXPORTED FROM utils -  . . .
         -  BEGIN -    myrt(5)   -- Error since myrout is not a procedure 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper routine is being called.  If it is a function,
         then put the call in the appropriate expression form. 


17478  0-INFO 


17479  0-INFO List of programs expected 

       Cause:
         A list of program identifiers is expected.  Instead, the line
         contained an empty list or the ALL specification.  For example, the
         "ACTIVATE ALL" statement will cause this error since ALL is not a
         valid option for the ACTIVATE statement. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the empty list or ALL specification with the appropriate
         list of program identifiers. 


17480  0-INFO List of programs or ALL expected 

       Cause:
         A list of program identifiers or the ALL specification is expected.
         Instead, the line contained an empty list.  For example, the
         "UNPAUSE" statement will cause this error since an empty list is
         not a valid option for the UNPAUSE statement. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the empty list with the ALL specification or the
         appropriate list of program identifiers. 


17481  0-INFO Statement not permitted in a PLC program 

       Cause:
         The statement is not permitted in a program having the PLC program
         attribute.  There is a limited set of statements permitted in PLC
         programs. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the invalid statement or remove the PLC attribute. 


17482  0-INFO Invalid port variable 

       Cause:
         An invalid port was specified in the statement.  For example, the
         PULSE statement can pulse $DOUT and $BIT only.  Therefore, the
         "PULSE $SDO[2] FOR 200" statement will produce this error. 

       Remedy:
         Use a valid port specification in the statement. 


17483  0-INFO PLC prog cannot include user-defined variables 

       Cause:
         Programs having the PLC program type attribute cannot contain
         user-defined variables.  The only variables accessible from a PLC
         type program is the predefined ports mentioned in the
         documentation. 

       Remedy:
         Delete the variable declarations and their usages or remove the PLC
         attribute. 


17484  0-INFO Cannot implicitly declare vars in routine 

       Cause:
         The automatic declaration of undefined variables is only permitted
         in the program.  All undefined identifiers in a routine cause this
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the identifier name.  If correct, add a local
         declaration of the identifier. 


17485  0-INFO Cannot import routine variables 

       Cause:
         The EXPORTED FROM clause is not permitted on local variable
         declarations.  If specified, this error will be detected. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the EXPORTED FROM clause from the local variable
         declaration. 


17486  0-INFO Id <id> must be an INTEGER variable 

       Cause:
         Several statements in the language require an INTEGER variable
         reference.  If an identifier of any other type or kind is
         specified, this error is detected.  The following program segment
         shows two example statements that will cause this error. - -  CONST
         myconst = 8 -  VAR myvar : REAL -  . . . -  BEGIN -    -- Error
         since myvar is not an INTEGER -    FOR myvar := 1 TO 10 DO -    . .
         . -    -- Error since myconst is not a variable -    FOR myconst :=
         1 TO 10 DO 

       Remedy:
         Replace the identifier with a valid INTEGER variable reference. 


17487  0-INFO Unknown system variable <sys_var_id> 

       Cause:
         A system variable is referenced that is not known to the system. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the system variable name and use the proper
         spelling. 


17488  0-INFO No direct access to system var <sys_var_id> 

       Cause:
         Direct access to the system variable is not permitted.  Instead,
         the routines must be used to access this system variable. 

       Remedy:
         Use the appropriate built-in routine for accessing the system
         variable. 


17489  0-INFO Invalid use of identifier <id> 

       Cause:
         This error indicates an invalid indexing or fielding of an
         identifier that is not a variable. 

       Remedy:
         Use the proper variable identifier in the statement. 


17490  0-INFO System var <sys_var_id> only has READ access 

       Cause:
         The system variable cannot be given a new value by a PDL2 program.
         This means it cannot be used as the left operand in an assignment
         statement and it cannot be used in the READ statement. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


17491  0-INFO Port variables must be indexed 

       Cause:
         A port variable cannot be accessed as an entire ARRAY.  It must be
         indexed.  Therefore, the "avar := $DIN" statement is invalid since
         $DIN is not indexed. 

       Remedy:
         Index the port using the proper indexing value. 


17492  0-INFO GOTO in a PLC program must jump forward 

       Cause:
         The GOTO statement in a PLC program must jump to a label that is
         defined after the GOTO statement.  This error is detected if the
         GOTO statement jumps to a label that is defined prior to the GOTO
         statement. - -  PROGRAM myprog PLC -  . . . -  BEGIN -    . . . - 
         mylabel:: -    . . . -    -- Error since label precedes the GOTO
         Statement -    GOTO mylabel 

       Remedy:
         Fix the logic in the program so that the GOTO does not jump
         backwards. 


17493  0-INFO PLC prog cannot access system var <sys_var_id> 

       Cause:
         The statement being translated contains a reference to a system
         variable that cannot be accessed by a program having the PLC
         program type attribute. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the reference to the system variable or remove the PLC
         attribute. 


17494  0-INFO Operator not permitted in a PLC program 

       Cause:
         The statement being translated contains a reference to an operator
         that cannot be used by a program having the PLC program type
         attribute. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the use of the operator or remove the PLC attribute. 


17495  0-INFO PLC programs cannot contain REAL values 

       Cause:
         The statement being translated contains a REAL literal which cannot
         be used in a program having the PLC program type attribute. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the use of the REAL literal or remove the PLC attribute. 


17496  0-INFO Adding ADVANCE to PULSE as required in PLC prog 

       Cause:
         All PULSE statements are automatically advanced when executed by
         the software or hardware PLC.  The PULSE statement being translated
         does not include the ADVANCE option so the translation process will
         automatically add it.  This warning is given to indicate the
         automatic insertion of the ADVANCE option. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17497  0-INFO RETURN statement only permitted in routines 

       Cause:
         The RETURN statement is only permitted in the executable section of
         a routine.  If specified in the executable section of the program,
         this error is detected. 

       Remedy:
         Delete the RETURN statements from the executable section of the
         program. 


17498  0-INFO RETURN from a function need a value 

       Cause:
         The RETURN statement requires a function return value when
         contained in the executable section of a function routine.  This
         error is detected if the function return value is omitted from the
         RETURN statement. 

       Remedy:
         Add the function return value to the RETURN statement. 


17499  0-INFO RETURN from a proc cannot specify a value 

       Cause:
         The RETURN statement is not permitted to have a function return
         value when contained in the executable section of a procedure
         routine.  This error is detected if the function return value is
         included on the RETURN statement of a procedure. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the function return value from the RETURN statement. 


17500  0-INFO Id <id> must be a SEMAPHORE variable 

       Cause:
         Several statements in the language require a SEMAPHORE variable
         reference.  If an identifier of any other type or kind is
         specified, this error is detected.  The following program segment
         shows two example statements that will cause this error. - -  CONST
         myconst = 8 -  VAR myvar : REAL -  . . . -  BEGIN -    -- Error
         since myvar is not a SEMAPHORE -    SIGNAL myvar -    . . . -    --
         Error since myconst is not a variable -    SIGNAL myconst 

       Remedy:
         Replace the identifier with a valid SEMAPHORE variable reference. 


17501  0-INFO Code follows the END of the program 

       Cause:
         Statements other than comments follow the END of the program. 

       Remedy:
         Either delete them or move them above the END statement. 


17502  0-INFO Invalid variable in a READ statement 

       Cause:
         Items in the list of a READ statement must be valid variable
         references.  If an identifier that is not a variable is specified
         in the READ statement, this error is detected. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the identifier reference so that it is a valid variable
         reference. 


17503  0-INFO Cannot READ variables of this data type 

       Cause:
         A variable specified in the READ statement cannot be read because
         of its data type.  For example, if "myvar" is declared as a PATH,
         the "READ(myvar)" statement would cause this error since it cannot
         read variables of type PATH. 

       Remedy:
         The individual components will have to be READ. 


17504  0-INFO Cannot AND conditions in a TIL 

       Cause:
         The AND operator cannot be used to combine conditions in a TIL
         clause. 

       Remedy:
         Use multiple TIL clauses to check multiple conditions. 


17505  0-INFO Invalid context for a label 

       Cause:
         A label cannot be used to label a middle line of a
         CONDITION..ENDCONDITION statement, a MOVE..ENDMOVE statement, or
         OPEN FILE..ENDOPEN statement.  Only the first line of such
         statements can be labeled. - -  BEGIN -    -- Valid since on first
         line of statement -  mylabel1:: CONDITION[3]: -    . . . -    --
         Error since in middle line of statement -  mylabel2:: -   
         ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Move the label before or after the multi-lined statement. 


17506  0-INFO Invalid variable in a DECODE statement 

       Cause:
         Items in the list of a DECODE statement must be valid variable
         references.  If an identifier that is not a variable is specified
         in the DECODE statement, this error is detected. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the identifier reference so that it is a valid variable
         reference. 


17507  0-INFO Cannot DECODE variables of this data type 

       Cause:
         A variable specified in the DECODE statement cannot be used because
         of its data type.  For example, if "myvar" is declared as a PATH,
         the "DECODE(myvar)" statement would cause this error since we
         cannot decode variables of type PATH. 

       Remedy:
         The individual components will have to be used in the DECODE
         statement. 


17508  0-INFO Identifier <id> must be a STRING variable 

       Cause:
         Several statements in the language require a STRING variable
         reference.  If an identifier of any other type or kind is
         specified, this error is detected.  The following program segment
         shows two example statements that will cause this error. - -  CONST
         myconst = 'Junk string' -  VAR myvar : REAL -  . . . -  BEGIN -   
         -- Error since myvar is not a STRING -    ENCODE(myvar, 8) -    . .
         . -    -- Error since myconst is not a var -    ENCODE(myconst, 8) 

       Remedy:
         Replace the identifier with a valid STRING variable reference. 


17509  0-INFO STRING expression expected 

       Cause:
         The expression must result in a STRING value. For example, the
         expression for the file name in an OPEN FILE statement must result
         in a STRING value.  Therefore, the following example will cause
         this error. - -  VAR myvar : INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -    --
         Error since 5.6 is not a STRING exp -    OPEN FILE myvar (5.6,
         'ro') 

       Remedy:
         Fix the expression so it results in a STRING value. 


17510  0-INFO Cannot ENCODE variables of this data type 

       Cause:
         A variable specified in the ENCODE statement cannot be read because
         of its data type.  For example, if "myvar" is declared as a PATH,
         the "ENCODE(s, myvar)" statement would cause this error since it
         cannot encode variables of type PATH. 

       Remedy:
         The individual components will have to be ENCODED. 


17511  0-INFO Codice espressione non valido 


17512  0-INFO Codice istruzione non valido 


17513  0-INFO Statement not permitted in a NOHOLD program 

       Cause:
         The statement is not permitted in a program having the NOHOLD
         program attribute.  All statements related to motion of an arm are
         disallowed in a NOHOLD program. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the statements that are disallowed or remove the NOHOLD
         attribute. 


17514  0-INFO Routine declaration conflicts with the previous 

       Cause:
         When a function routine is exported, the routine header containing
         the EXPORTED FROM clause and the actual routine header must be
         identical.  If the function return type does not match, this error
         is detected.  The following example will cause this error since one
         ROUTINE declaration indicates an INTEGER return value and the other
         indicates a REAL return value. - -  PROGRAM myprog -  . . . - 
         ROUTINE myrt(i : INTEGER) : REAL EXPORTED FROM myprog -  . . . - 
         -- Error since return type doesn't match -  ROUTINE myrt(i :
         INTEGER) : INTEGER -  BEGIN -    . . . -  END myrt 

       Remedy:
         Fix the declarations so that they match. 


17515  0-INFO Parameter list decl conflicts with the previous 

       Cause:
         When a routine is exported, the routine header containing the
         EXPORTED FROM clause and the actual routine header must be
         identical.  If the number of parameters or the data type of
         corresponding parameters does not match, this error is detected. 
         The following example will cause this error since one ROUTINE
         declaration indicates "myrout" has 2 parameters and the other
         indicates only 1 parameter. - -  PROGRAM myprog -  . . . -  ROUTINE
         myrout(i, j : INTEGER) EXPORTED FROM myprog -  . . . -  -- Error
         since number or param mismatch -  ROUTINE myrout(i : INTEGER) - 
         BEGIN -    . . . -  END myrout 

       Remedy:
         Fix the declarations so that they match. 


17516  0-INFO 


17517  0-INFO Ignoring CYCLE as not permitted on a routine BEGIN 

       Cause:
         The routine BEGIN statement being translated includes the CYCLE
         option so the translation process will automatically ignore it. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17518  0-INFO Parameters not allowed in rout of PLC program 

       Cause:
         User-defined routines owned by PLC programs cannot have parameters. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the parameters from the routine or remove the PLC attribute
         from the PROGRAM statement. 


17519  0-INFO PLC program cannot contain function routines 

       Cause:
         User-defined routines owned by PLC programs cannot be functions. 

       Remedy:
         Make the routine a procedure or remove the PLC attribute from the
         PROGRAM statement. 


17520  0-INFO PLC prog cannot contain imported/exported routines 

       Cause:
         A PLC program cannot import or export user-defined routines. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the import/export declaration or remove the PLC attribute
         from the PROGRAM statement. 


17521  0-INFO EXIT CYCLE in PLC prog cannot have a prog list 

       Cause:
         The EXIT CYCLE statement cannot specify other programs if contained
         within a PLC program.  This means a PLC program can only effect its
         own execution cycle. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the program list from the EXIT CYCLE statement or remove the
         PLC attribute from the PROGRAM statement. 


17522  0-INFO Must be a predefined constant identifier 

       Cause:
         The identifier used must be a predefined constant.  This error is
         detected when an identifier not a predefined constant is used as
         the value for a user-defined constant. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the reference with a literal value or a predefined constant
         identifier. 


17523  0-INFO 


17524  0-INFO Arg of this type must be passed by ref to ISR 

       Cause:
         Arguments to an interrupt service routine can only be passed by
         value if they are INTEGER, REAL, or BOOLEAN.  All other types must
         be passed by reference to an interrupt service routine. 

       Remedy:
         Pass the argument by reference. 


17525  0-INFO Inserting END 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an END for a BEGIN statement. 
         This warning indicates the appropriate END is automatically being
         added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17526  0-INFO Inserting ENDFOR 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDFOR to terminate a FOR
         statement.  This warning indicates the appropriate ENDFOR is
         automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17527  0-INFO Inserting ENDWHILE 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDWHILE to terminate a
         WHILE statement.  This warning indicates the appropriate ENDWHILE
         is automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17528  0-INFO Inserting ENDIF 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDIF to terminate a IF
         statement.  This warning indicates the appropriate ENDIF is
         automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17529  0-INFO Missing WHEN clause 

       Cause:
         A CONDITION..ENDCONDITION statement does not have any WHEN clauses.
         This is an empty condition handler definition. 

       Remedy:
         Add the appropriate WHEN clause and action list or delete the
         CONDITION..ENDCONDITION statement. 


17530  0-INFO Inserting ENDCONDITION 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDCONDITION to terminate a
         CONDITION statement.  This warning indicates the appropriate
         ENDCONDITION is automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17531  0-INFO Local variables not permitted in conditions 

       Cause:
         Local variables and parameters are not permitted in the definition
         of a condition handler.  Only program variables can be used. - -  .
         . . -  ROUTINE myrout(myparam : INTEGER) -  BEGIN -   
         CONDITION[1]: -      -- Error since myparam is not a program
         variable -      WHEN myparam = 5 DO -      . . . -    ENDCONDITION
         -    . . . -  END myrout 

       Remedy:
         Remove all local variable and parameters from the conditions. 


17532  0-INFO Invalid data type used in relational condition 

       Cause:
         Relational conditions in a WHEN, TIL, or WAIT FOR can only compare
         INTEGER, REAL, or BOOLEAN values.  This error is detected when
         other data types are used. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to compare either INTEGER, REAL, or BOOLEAN
         operands. 


17533  0-INFO Relational condition must contain a variable 

       Cause:
         One of the operands of a relational condition in a WHEN, TIL, or
         WAIT FOR must be a program variable.  For example, the "WHEN 5 = 9
         DO" statement will cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Replace one of the relational operands with a program variable
         reference. 


17535  0-INFO BOOLEAN variable or port expected 

       Cause:
         A BOOLEAN program variable or a BOOLEAN port reference must be used
         in this type of condition.  For example, if "myvar" is an INTEGER
         program variable, the "WHEN myvar DO" statement will cause this
         error since myvar is not BOOLEAN. 

       Remedy:
         Change the reference to be a BOOLEAN program variable or a BOOLEAN
         port reference.  If the reference is an INTEGER or REAL program
         variable, a relational condition can be used. 


17536  0-INFO Cannot AND event conditions 

       Cause:
         The AND operator cannot be used to combine multiple event
         conditions in a WHEN, TIL, or WAIT FOR.  It can be used if one of
         the operands is a state condition.  The following example will
         cause this error since both START and POWERUP are event conditions.
         - -    . . . -    CONDITION[2]: -      -- Error since both are
         event conditions -      WHEN START AND POWERUP DO -      . . . -   
         ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Make sure at least one of the operands of the AND is a state
         condition or replace the AND with an OR (whichever is correct for
         the logic of the program.) 


17537  0-INFO Invalid data type for local variable 

       Cause:
         Local variables (those declared in a routine) cannot be of type
         SEMAPHORE or PATH.  This error is detected when such a declaration
         is translated. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the declaration and use a parameter or global variable. 


17538  0-INFO Value used twice in same SELECT / TRY statement 

       Cause:
         A value can only appear once in the CASE clauses of a SELECT or
         CATCH clauses of a TRY statement.  This error is detected when
         multiple instances of the same value are detected in the same CASE
         or the same value appears in multiple CASE clauses of the same
         SELECT. The following program segment contains two example
         statements what will cause this error. - -  CONST myconst = 5 - 
         VAR myvar : INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -    SELECT myvar OF -     
         CASE(5): -        . . . -      -- Error since 5 is already used in
         a CASE -      CASE(myconst): -        . . . -      -- Error since 6
         appears more than once -      CASE(6, 7, 6): -        . . . -   
         ENDSELECT 

       Remedy:
         Make sure each value appears only once in the same SELECT
         statement. 


17539  0-INFO Cannot compare these types in a condition 

       Cause:
         The operands used in a relational condition are of incompatible
         types. This means one is BOOLEAN and the other is either REAL or
         INTEGER. 

       Remedy:
         Use the appropriate operands in the relational condition. 


17540  0-INFO Invalid BOOLEAN condition operator 

       Cause:
         Only the equality (=) and inequality (<>) operators can be used
         with BOOLEAN operands.  This error is detected when the operands
         are BOOLEAN but a different operator is used in a condition. 

       Remedy:
         Use the appropriate = or <> operator or change the operands in the
         condition. 


17541  0-INFO 


17542  0-INFO 


17543  0-INFO Inserting ENDSELECT 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDSELECT to terminate a
         SELECT statement.  This warning indicates the appropriate ENDSELECT
         is automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17544  0-INFO Inserting UNTIL TRUE 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an UNTIL to terminate a REPEAT
         statement.  This warning indicates the "UNTIL TRUE" statement is
         automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         The "UNTIL TRUE" statement should be modified to replace "TRUE"
         with the proper terminating expression. 


17545  0-INFO Trajectory value <id> is invalid 

       Cause:
         The specified value is invalid for a trajectory of a MOVE
         statement. The only valid values for the trajectory are LINEAR,
         CIRCULAR, and JOINT. 

       Remedy:
         Use one of the valid trajectory values. 


17546  0-INFO Adding ADVANCE to PULSE as in an action 

       Cause:
         The PULSE action statement being translated does not include the
         ADVANCE option so the translation process will automatically add
         it. A PULSE action is automatically advanced. Therefore, the
         ADVANCE option on the PULSE action statement is required.  This
         warning is given to indicate the automatic insertion of the ADVANCE
         option. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17547  0-INFO Action assignment disallowed on variables of this type 

       Cause:
         Assignment action statements are only valid if the left operand is
         an INTEGER, REAL, or BOOLEAN variable.  For example, if "myvar" is
         declared as a STRING variable, the "myvar := 'invalid'" action
         statement is invalid since it involves the assignment of a STRING
         variable. 

       Remedy:
         Either remove the invalid action statement or put it in a routine
         and add a routine call to the action list. 


17548  0-INFO Last action must be a routine call 

       Cause:
         All routine actions must be at the end of the action list and
         cannot be intermixed with other types of action statement.  This
         error occurs if the translation process detects an action other
         than a routine call following the first routine call action. 

       Remedy:
         Move all routine call actions to the end of the action list. 


17549  0-INFO Invalid POSITION operator 

       Cause:
         The operator cannot be used with POSITION operands. For example,
         the "+" operator cannot have POSITION operands. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper operands and operators are specified in the
         expression. 


17550  0-INFO Identifier <id> must be a label 

       Cause:
         The identifier specified is not a label.  This error is detected
         when a label identifier is expected.  For example, if "myvar" is
         declared as a variable, the "GOTO myvar" statement would result in
         this error since myvar is not a label. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the identifier and make sure it is a label
         identifier. 


17551  0-INFO Must specify at least one joint value 

       Cause:
         The joint list in a MOVE statement must include at least one joint
         value.  The translation process detected the { } without any joint
         values. 

       Remedy:
         Add the appropriate joint values.  Use consecutive commas for empty
         values. 


17552  0-INFO Inserting the identifier to END statement 

       Cause:
         Each END statement must include the routine or program identifier
         name of the routine or program being ended. This warning is given
         if the translation process has to automatically add the identifier
         name to the END statement. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17553  0-INFO Token stack corrotto 


17554  0-INFO Incomplete statement 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an incomplete statement that it
         could not determine how to automatically finish. 

       Remedy:
         Complete the statement with the appropriate information. 


17556  0-INFO Cannot WRITE expression of this data type 

       Cause:
         An expression specified in the WRITE statement cannot be written
         because of its data type.  For example, if "myvar" is declared as a
         PATH, the "WRITE(myvar)" statement would cause this error since it
         is invalid to write variables of type PATH. 

       Remedy:
         The individual components of each node will have to be written. 


17557  0-INFO Invalid use of system variables in assignment action 

       Cause:
         It is invalid to use an assignment action in a condition handler if
         the target of the assignment is a system variable that requires
         locking. In addition, the limited access predefined node fields
         cannot be used as the target of an assignment action. If the target
         is a system variable or predefined node field that requires limit
         checking, it is an error if the value being assigned is NOT a
         constant or literal. The following example will cause this error
         since $MOVE_TYPE requires limit checking and the value being
         assigned is a variable. - -  CONDITION[1]: -    WHEN $DIN[1]+ DO - 
         $MOVE_TYPE := myvar -  ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Either remove the assignment action or put it in a routine and add
         the routine call to the action list. 


17558  0-INFO Program and file name must match 

       Cause:
         This error is detected during the FILER TRANSLATE process.  The
         identifier name used in the PROGRAM statement must match the name
         of the file being translated (without the file extension.)  This
         error is the result of a mismatch between those two names. 

       Remedy:
         Either rename the file or edit the file and change the identifier
         in the PROGRAM statement. 


17559  0-INFO Data type of expression not matching function definition 

       Cause:
         The data type of the expression used in the RETURN statement must
         be compatible with the function return type definition.  This error
         results if there is a mismatch.   The following example will cause
         this error since a BOOLEAN expression is not compatible with the
         defined INTEGER return type. - -  -- Return type is INTEGER - 
         ROUTINE myrout(i : INTEGER) : INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -    . . .
         -    RETURN(TRUE)   -- Error since value is not INTEGER -  END
         myrout 

       Remedy:
         Either fix the expression being used in the RETURN statement or
         change the data type of the return value from the function. 


17560  0-INFO Inserting <res_word/symbol> 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get the specified reserved word or
         symbol while translating a statement. This warning indicates the
         specified word or symbol is automatically being added in order to
         continue translation of the statement. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed.  However, if the
         translation process chose the improper word or symbol, the
         statement may have to be edited. 


17561  0-INFO Replacing with <res_word/symbol> 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an invalid item and can continue
         translation if it is replaced with the specified information. This
         warning is given to indicate the automatic replacement is being
         made. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17562  0-INFO Ignoring <string> 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an invalid item and can continue
         translation if it is ignored.  This warning is given to indicate
         the automatic deletion of the specified item. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17563  0-INFO Invalid token <string> 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an invalid item in the statement
         being translated. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the invalid item with the appropriate valid information. 


17564  0-INFO Errors detected during translation but saved 

       Cause:
         Errors were detected during the translation process. This means
         that the program cannot be loaded into memory for execution. 

       Remedy:
         Edit the program and fix all of the errors. 


17565  0-INFO Warnings detected during translation but saved 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected some warnings during translation.
         There were no errors which means the program CAN be loaded into
         memory for execution. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy.  The warnings are informational. 


17566  0-INFO Severe error detected so aborting translation 

       Cause:
         The translation operations has been aborted due to a severe error.
         A severe error can be failure to import a specific file. 

       Remedy:
         Check the reported error. 


17567  0-INFO Cannot change the program name 

       Cause:
         The identifier name in the PROGRAM statement must match the name of
         the file.  This error results if you try to change the identifier
         name in the PROGRAM statement. 

       Remedy:
         Do not change the name. If necessary, translate the file in the
         ASCII format (.PDL), edit the program and retranslate it. 


17568  0-INFO Missing CASE clause 

       Cause:
         A SELECT..ENDSELECT statement does not have any CASE clauses. This
         is an empty SELECT statement. 

       Remedy:
         Add the appropriate CASE clauses or delete the SELECT..ENDSELECT
         statement. 


17569  0-INFO Inserting BEGIN and END of the routine 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get a BEGIN or END statement for a
         routine.  This warning indicates the appropriate BEGIN and END
         statements are automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17570  0-INFO System variable field <sys_var_field_id> is unknown 

       Cause:
         The field used in a structured system variable reference is
         unknown. For example, the "$ARM_DATA[1].myvar" will produce this
         error since "myvar" is not a known system variable field. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the field name and make sure it is a valid
         field for the structured system variable being referenced. 


17571  0-INFO System variable field <sys_var_field_id> is invalid 

       Cause:
         The field used in a structured system variable reference is not a
         valid field for that system variable. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the field name and make sure it is a valid
         field for the structured system variable being referenced. 


17572  0-INFO Inserting ENDOPEN 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDOPEN to terminate a
         multiple lined OPEN statement.  This warning indicates the
         appropriate ENDOPEN is automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17573  0-INFO Inserting ENDMOVE 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDMOVE to terminate a
         multiple lined MOVE statement.  This warning indicates the
         appropriate ENDMOVE is automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17574  0-INFO System var <sys_var_id> not permitted in a WITH 

       Cause:
         The specified system variable cannot be used in a WITH clause. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the system variable name and be sure it can
         be used in a WITH clause. 


17575  0-INFO Invalid context for WITH clause 

       Cause:
         The system variable used in a WITH clause is invalid for the
         current statement context.  For example, $FL_SWAP can be used in a
         WITH clause but only in an OPEN FILE statement.  Therefore, this
         error will result if it is used in the WITH clause of a MOVE
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the appropriate system variables are used in the current
         statement context. 


17576  0-INFO Invalid sys var <sys_var_id> in WITH clause 

       Cause:
         The specified system variable cannot be used in a WITH clause. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the system variable name and be sure it can
         be used in a WITH clause. 


17577  0-INFO Changing to SYNCMOVE since statement is not FLY 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected a SYNCMOVEFLY clause but the MOVE
         statement didn't indicate FLY.  Therefore, the SYNCMOVEFLY is
         automatically being replaced with SYNCMOVE to match the MOVE
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17578  0-INFO Changing to SYNCMOVEFLY since statement is FLY 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected a SYNCMOVE clause but the MOVEFLY
         statement indicates FLY.  Therefore, the SYNCMOVE is automatically
         being replaced with SYNCMOVEFLY to match the MOVEFLY statement. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17579  0-INFO Invalid routine return type 

       Cause:
         A function cannot return all data types.  For example, the "ROUTINE
         dog : SEMAPHORE" will cause this error since a function cannot
         return a SEMAPHORE value. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the return type specification in the routine header. 


17580  0-INFO Predefined field <field_id> is invalid 

       Cause:
         The field name of a predefined data type is invalid.  The following
         example causes this error since AUX is not a valid predefined field
         for the POSITION data type. - -  VAR myvar : POSITION -  . . . - 
         BEGIN -    -- Valid since X is valid field of a POSITION -   
         myvar.X -    -- Error since AUX is not a valid field of a POSITION
         -    myvar.AUX 

       Remedy:
         Use a valid predefined field name. 


17581  0-INFO Error opening <file_name>.err file 

       Cause:
         The file containing the translation error and warning messages
         could not be opened.  This could be caused by not having enough
         disk space for the file. 

       Remedy:
         Erase all unnecessary files and issue the FILER TRANSLATE command
         again. 


17582  0-INFO Invalid port used in event condition 

       Cause:
         Only certain ports can be used in port event conditions. The
         translation process detected an invalid port. 

       Remedy:
         In case of positive or negative transition (for example WHEN
         $DIN[1]+), it is only allowed to use the following ports: $DIN,
         $DOUT, $SDI, $SDO, $BIT. In case of BIT_FLIP routine, only analogic
         ports, except $TIMER, can be passed as first parameter to the
         routine. 


17584  0-INFO String value <string> is invalid 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an invalid STRING literal. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the literal so it is a valid STRING. 


17585  0-INFO REAL value <real_value> is invalid 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an invalid REAL literal value. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the literal to be a valid REAL value. 


17586  0-INFO Frame value <frame> is invalid 

       Cause:
         The frame specification in the MOVE statements can be either BASE
         or TOOL.  The translation process detected some other identifier. 

       Remedy:
         Change the frame reference to be either BASE or TOOL. 


17587  0-INFO Invalid second argument in routine 

       Cause:
         The second argument to the routines must be a user-defined variable
         reference.  The translation process detected either a system
         variable or a non-variable reference. 

       Remedy:
         Change the second argument to be a user-defined variable reference. 


17588  0-INFO Only one format specification permitted on arguments 

       Cause:
         Only one format specifier can be used on the arguments for the
         routines. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the extra format specifiers. 


17589  0-INFO Invalid sys var argument in routine 

       Cause:
         The system variable reference in the routines must be a system
         variable reference that is not a port. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the argument to be a system variable reference that is not a
         port.  Also make sure it is passed by reference to the routine. 


17590  0-INFO Invalid type for the target in routine 

       Cause:
         The target argument in the routine cannot be a NODE, RECORD, ARRAY
         OF RECORD, PATH, SEMAPHORE, ARRAY OF STRING, ARRAY OF JOINTPOS,
         XTNDPOS, or ARRAY OF XTNDPOS. 

       Remedy:
         Individual components of these types must be used instead of the
         entire variable at once. 


17591  0-INFO Argument in SYS_VAR rout cannot be a port 

       Cause:
         The target of the SYS_VAR_GET and SYS_VAR_SET routines cannot be a
         port reference. 

       Remedy:
         Use a non-port variable reference as the target. 


17592  0-INFO Can't have format specifiers for an expression 

       Cause:
         Format specifiers are not permitted on expression arguments of the
         SYS_VAR_GET and SYS_VAR_SET routines.  They are only permitted on
         those arguments that are passed by reference. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the format specifiers from the expression arguments. 


17593  0-INFO Inserting BEGIN and END of the program 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get a BEGIN or END statement for
         the program.  This warning indicates the appropriate BEGIN and END
         statements are automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17594  0-INFO Prog has references to undefined labels 

       Cause:
         A label is used in a GOTO statement but is not actually used to
         label a line of code.  This error is detected when the program is
         saved and loaded as well as when the editor checks for errors. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the labels used in the GOTO statements are properly
         typed. If so, add the label to the appropriate line so that it gets
         defined. 


17595  0-INFO Missing fields in TYPE definition 

       Cause:
         A RECORD..ENDRECORD or NODEDEF..ENDNODEDEF statement does not have
         any field definitions. This is an empty user-defined type
         definition. 

       Remedy:
         Add the appropriate field definitions or delete the type definition
         statement. 


17596  0-INFO Inserting ENDRECORD 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDRECORD to terminate a
         RECORD declaration.  This warning indicates the appropriate
         ENDRECORD is automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17597  0-INFO Inserting ENDNODEDEF 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDNODEDEF to terminate a
         NODE declaration.  This warning indicates the appropriate
         ENDNODEDEF is automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17598  0-INFO Replacing with ENDRECORD 

       Cause:
         An ENDNODEDEF statement was used to terminate a RECORD definition. 
         This warning is issued indicating the ENDNODEDEF is automatically
         being replaced with ENDRECORD. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17599  0-INFO Replacing with ENDNODEDEF 

       Cause:
         An ENDRECORD statement was used to terminate a NODE definition. 
         This warning is issued indicating the ENDRECORD is automatically
         being replaced with ENDNODEDEF. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17600  0-INFO Inserting missing TYPE keyword 

       Cause:
         Each new user-defined type section must begin with the TYPE
         keyword.  This warning is given if the translation process has to
         automatically add the keyword. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17601  0-INFO Field <field_id> already declared in this TYPE 

       Cause:
         A field name can only be used once within the same user-defined
         type declaration.  This error is the result of the translation
         process detecting a field name that has already been used in the
         same type declaration. - -  TYPE mytype = RECORD -      i : INTEGER
         -      . . . -      -- Error since i is already a declared field - 
         j, i : INTEGER -    ENDRECORD 

       Remedy:
         Choose a different name. 


17602  0-INFO Field <field_id> is invalid for this TYPE 

       Cause:
         The specified field name is invalid.  The following example will
         cause this error since "fld2" is not  declared as a field for type
         "mytype". - -  TYPE mytype = RECORD -      i : INTEGER -      j :
         INTEGER -    ENDRECORD -    . . . -  VAR myvar : mytype -    . . .
         -  BEGIN -    -- Valid since i is a field of mytype -    myvar.i :=
         98 -    . . . -    -- Error since fld2 is not a field of mytype -  
         myvar.fld2 := 98 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the field name and make sure it is a valid
         field.  If it is a valid name, add the field definition to the TYPE
         declaration. 


17603  0-INFO Translating <file_name>: 

       Cause:
         This is an informational message. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


17604  0-INFO Invalid access to system variable <sys_var_id> 

       Cause:
         The specified system variable cannot be accessed in a manner used
         in the statement being translated. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the reference to the system variable. 


17605  0-INFO NODISABLE already specified 

       Cause:
         This warning is detected when the NODISABLE option is specified
         more than one time on a CONDITION statement.  The extra
         specifications are ignored. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17606  0-INFO ARM already specified 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when multiple arm options are specified on
         the CONDITION statement. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper arm option and delete the other(s). 


17607  0-INFO CYCLE already specified 

       Cause:
         If the CYCLE option is already specified on the BEGIN statement the
         program cannot contain a CYCLE statement.  In addition, if the
         CYCLE statement exists the CYCLE option cannot be added to the
         BEGIN statement.  This error is detected when both CYCLEs exist. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the incorrect CYCLE specification. 


17608  0-INFO CYCLE not permitted in routines 

       Cause:
         The CYCLE option is not permitted on the BEGIN statement for a
         routine.  If specified, it will be ignored and this warning will be
         issued. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17609  0-INFO CYCLE statement not permitted in PLC program 

       Cause:
         Programs having the PLC program attribute cannot contain the CYCLE
         statement since the CYCLE option is mandatory for the BEGIN
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         Delete the CYCLE statement or remove the PLC attribute. 


17610  0-INFO Fields cannot be SEMAPHORE data type 

       Cause:
         The field of a user-defined type cannot be a SEMAPHORE. 

       Remedy:
         Delete the SEMAPHORE field. 


17611  0-INFO Condition not permitted for use in a TIL 

       Cause:
         Not all conditions are permitted in a TIL clause.  The translation
         process has detected an invalid condition in a TIL clause. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the invalid condition from the TIL clause. 


17612  0-INFO Missing ADVANCE on FLY motion 

       Cause:
         It is advised to use the ADVANCE option on all FLY motion in order
         to have the full advantages of the FLY.  This warning indicates the
         ADVANCE option is missing on a FLY motion. 

       Remedy:
         The ADVANCE option should be added to the FLY motion. 


17613  0-INFO Rout <rout_id> must be decl before it is used 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected a routine call before the
         declaration of the routine.  All routine declarations must come
         before any calls to those routines. 

       Remedy:
         Move the routine declaration above the call. 


17614  0-INFO Identifier expected 

       Cause:
         The translation process was expecting an identifier reference but
         detected some other information. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use an identifier reference in the
         appropriate spot. 


17615  0-INFO System variable identifier expected 

       Cause:
         The translation process was expecting a system variable reference
         but detected some other information. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use a system variable reference in the
         appropriate spot. 


17616  0-INFO Operator token expected 

       Cause:
         The translation process was expecting an operator but detected some
         other information. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use an operator in the appropriate spot. 


17617  0-INFO Punctuation token expected 

       Cause:
         The translation process was expecting a punctuation token but
         detected some other information. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use the appropriate punctuation in the
         appropriate spot. 


17618  0-INFO INTEGER literal expected 

       Cause:
         The translation process was expecting an INTEGER literal but
         detected some other information. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use an INTEGER literal in the appropriate
         spot. 


17619  0-INFO REAL literal expected 

       Cause:
         The translation process was expecting a REAL literal but detected
         some other information. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use a REAL literal in the appropriate spot. 


17620  0-INFO Invalid use of NOSAVE, GLOBAL, NODATA or CONST 

       Cause:
         The NOSAVE, GLOBAL, NODATA or CONST option is not permitted in this
         context.  For example, it is not permitted on a field definition in
         a user-defined type declaration (TYPE). 

       Remedy:
         Remove the option. 


17621  0-INFO Adding NOSAVE attr as required for SEMAPHORE 

       Cause:
         SEMAPHORE variables cannot be saved in a .VAR file.  Therefore, all
         SEMAPHORE variables are NOSAVE by default.  If not explicitly
         specified, the translation process will automatically add the
         NOSAVE attribute to the SEMAPHORE variable declaration. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17622  0-INFO Identifier <id> is invalid 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an invalid identifier name.  All
         identifiers must begin with a letter and can be followed by any
         number of letters, digits, or underscores. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the identifier to be valid. 


17623  0-INFO Maximum indentation level exceeded 

       Cause:
         The system has a maximum nesting indentation level of 31.  This
         means you cannot have statements nested within statements more than
         31 times.  The types of statements involved are loops, selection,
         condition handler definition, etc.  A program cannot be edited
         using the PDL2 program editor if this maximum is exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Modify the program to avoid exceeding the maximum indentation
         level. 


17624  0-INFO Invalid context for initialization 

       Cause:
         The initialization option is not valid for field definitions. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the initialization specification. 


17625  0-INFO Cannot initialize variables of this type 

       Cause:
         Variables of type INTEGER, REAL, BOOLEAN, and STRING can be
         initialized in the declaration.  All other types are disallowed. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the initialization from variable that are not INTEGER, REAL,
         BOOLEAN or STRING. 


17626  0-INFO Initialization value not matching var type 

       Cause:
         This error is the result of using an initialization value that is
         different than the data type of the variable.  The following
         example will cause this error since "myvar" is INTEGER and the
         initialization value is BOOLEAN. - -  -- Error since var is INTEGER
         but value is BOOLEAN -  VAR myvar : INTEGER (TRUE) 

       Remedy:
         Fix the initialization value or the data type so they are
         compatible. 


17627  0-INFO Missing NOSAVE on initialized declaration 

       Cause:
         Since initialized variables are assigned a new value every time the
         program begins execution, it is advised to make these NOSAVE
         variables.  The translation process will give this warning if a
         variable declaration includes the initialization option but does
         not include the NOSAVE option. 

       Remedy:
         The recommendation is to add the NOSAVE option. 


17628  0-INFO Cannot initialize imported variables 

       Cause:
         The initialization option cannot be included on variables that are
         imported from a different program. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the initialization from imported variables. 


17629  0-INFO Id <id> must be a constant (predefined or user defined) 

       Cause:
         The specified identifier must be a predefined or user-defined
         constant. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the identifier with a valid predefined or user-defined
         constant reference. 


17630  0-INFO Length of initial value exceeds variable length 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when the initialization clause is included
         in a STRING variable declaration.  It indicates that the length of
         the initialization value is longer than the maximum length defined
         for the STRING.  The following example will cause this error since
         the length of 'Initial Value' is greater than the STRING length of
         "myvar". - -  -- Error since initialization value is longer than 5
         - VAR myvar : STRING[5] ('Initial Value`) 

       Remedy:
         Use a shorter initialization value. 


17631  0-INFO Arm state attribute already specified 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when multiple default arm state attributes
         are specified on the PROGRAM statement. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper arm state attribute and delete the other(s). 


17632  0-INFO Port reference expected 

       Cause:
         Translation process is expecting a port variable reference. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the invalid reference with a valid port variable. 


17633  0-INFO Invalid port used as argument to PLC built-in 

       Cause:
         An invalid port is used as an argument to a PLC built-in.  Refer to
         the documentation on the PLC built-in being referenced for the list
         of valid ports. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the invalid port with a valid port reference. 


17634  0-INFO 


17635  0-INFO Variable number arguments not allowed in ISR 

       Cause:
         The action of a call routine in the condition cannot be issued on a
         routine with variable arguments 

       Remedy:
         Define routine without variable number of arguments 


17636  0-INFO Local var not permitted as arg. of ISR 

       Cause:
         Local variables and parameters are not permitted as arguments to
         interrupt service routines. 

       Remedy:
         Replace local variable and parameter references with valid program
         variable references or literals. 


17637  0-INFO ISR must have less than 17 arguments 

       Cause:
         An interrupt service routine is limited to having at most 16
         arguments. 

       Remedy:
         Rework the program so the routine does not require more than 16
         arguments. 


17638  0-INFO Cannot reference this built-in 

       Cause:
         The built-in routine cannot be referenced by a PDL2 program. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the routine call. 


17639  0-INFO Can't READ/DECODE sys vars with limits or locking 

       Cause:
         System variables that require locking or limit checking cannot be
         used in a READ or DECODE statement. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the reference to the system variable that requires locking
         or limit checking. 


17640  0-INFO Identifier not a node structure 

       Cause:
         The identifier used in a PATH variable declaration must be a NODE
         type.  The translation process detected an identifier which is not
         a NODE type. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the identifier with a valid NODE type. 


17641  0-INFO Standard node fields must come before user-defined fields 

       Cause:
         Standard node fields must be declared before the user-defined
         fields in a NODE definition. 

       Remedy:
         Move the standard node field definitions above the user-defined
         fields. 


17642  0-INFO Cannot specify arm on this standard node field 

       Cause:
         An arm specification can only be included on JOINTPOS and XTNDPOS
         type standard node fields. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the arm specification. 


17643  0-INFO Invalid standard node field 

       Cause:
         The system variable name is not a valid standard node field. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the invalid standard node field definition. 


17644  0-INFO Invalid use of NOTEACH 

       Cause:
         The NOTEACH option is not permitted in a RECORD type declaration. 
         It is only permitted on NODEDEF fields. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the NOTEACH option. 


17645  0-INFO Invalid indexing for a PATH node 

       Cause:
         The indexing for a PATH node can include only one index value.  The
         translation process detected more than one. 

       Remedy:
         Remove extra index values. 


17646  0-INFO Missing index on NODE reference 

       Cause:
         The referencing of a node field must include an indexed node.  The
         indexing of NODE was not detected. 

       Remedy:
         Include the indexing of the NODE field of a PATH before the field
         reference (<path>.NODE[<index>].<field>). 


17647  0-INFO Id <id> must be a PATH variable 

       Cause:
         The specified identifier must be a PATH variable.  It is not. 

       Remedy:
         Replace with a valid PATH variable identifier. 


17648  0-INFO Cannot have an ARRAY of NODEs 

       Cause:
         An ARRAY of NODE structures is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the declaration. 


17649  0-INFO Cannot use MOVE ALONG in multiple arm motions 

       Cause:
         The MOVE ALONG clause cannot be used in a multiple arm motion. 

       Remedy:
         Make the MOVE statement a single arm motion or remove the MOVE
         ALONG clause. 


17650  0-INFO Identifier not a user-defined data type 

       Cause:
         The identifier is not a user-defined data type which is expected by
         the translation process. 

       Remedy:
         Replace with a valid user-defined data type identifier. 


17651  0-INFO Local variables not permitted in actions 

       Cause:
         Local variables and parameters are not permitted in condition
         handler actions.  Only program variables can be used. 

       Remedy:
         Remove all local variable and parameters from the action list. 


17652  0-INFO Implicitly declaring standard node field
       <stnd_node_field_id> 

       Cause:
         If a standard node field is used in the executable section of a
         program and it is not currently defined in the NODEDEF type, the
         translation process will automatically insert a declaration for the
         standard node field.  This warning is given each time a standard
         node field is implicitly declared in a NODEDEF type. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17653  0-INFO ATTACH already specified 

       Cause:
         This warning is detected when the ATTACH option is specified more
         than one time on a CONDITION statement.  The extra specifications
         are ignored. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17654  0-INFO Can only ATTACH/DETACH CONDITIONS, ARMS, devices, and timers 

       Cause:
         The ATTACH/DETACH statements can only be used for CONDITIONs, ARMs,
         devices, and timers.  The translation process detected some other
         kind of reference in an ATTACH/DETACH statement. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the invalid reference. 


17655  0-INFO Cannot mix items in ATTACH/DETACH statements 

       Cause:
         The items in the ATTACH/DETACH statements must all be the same
         kind. The following example will cause this error since it mixes
         CONDITIONs and ARMs in the same ATTACH statement. - -  -- Error
         since can't mix attach items -  ATTACH CONDITION[1], ARM[1] 

       Remedy:
         Use separate statements. 


17656  0-INFO Invalid condition based on VIA point 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an invalid condition based on the
         VIA point. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the invalid condition. 


17657  0-INFO A $MAIN_/$AUX_ or $TOOL/$UFRAME or
       $SEG_TOOL_IDX/$SEG_REF_IDX field already declared in this node 

       Cause:
         Only one $MAIN_ and/or one $AUX_ standard node field can be
         specified in a NODE type declaration.  The following example will
         cause this error since it tries to include both $MAIN_POS and
         $MAIN_XTND in the NODEDEF. - - TYPE mytype = NODEDEF - $MAIN_POS -
         $MOVE_TYPE - -- Errore poich $MAIN_POS  gi specificata -
         $MAIN_XTND - j : INTEGER - ENDNODEDEF - 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper one and delete the other(s). 


17658  0-INFO Node value not permitted 

       Cause:
         The expression in the VIA, MOVE TO, MOVE NEAR, or MOVE FOR is a
         NODE value.  This can be caused by putting () around the node
         reference. If the data type is a NODE in these situations, it must
         be a node variable reference or indexed PATH node reference. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the () from the expression. 


17659  0-INFO Too many joint values specified 

       Cause:
         Too many joint values are specified in the MOVE statement.  The
         maximum number of joints is 10. 

       Remedy:
         Remove extra joint values from the statement. 


17660  0-INFO Inserting or completing a rout dcl 

       Cause:
         The translation process is either implicitly declaring a routine or
         it is completing one that has not been finished. This warning
         indicates the appropriate ROUTINE, BEGIN, and END statements are
         automatically being added.  In addition, an EXPORTED FROM
         declaration is created for the routine if it does not yet exist. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17661  0-INFO Mistmatch within attributes 

       Cause:
         ATTACH, DETACH, HOLD, NOHOLD attributes cannot be specified in
         program which foresee an implicit HOLD and ATTACH attribute. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper attributes and delete the other(s). 


17662  0-INFO Inserting an EXPORTED FROM routine declaration 

       Cause:
         The translation process is automatically inserting an EXPORTED FROM
         routine declaration when required (for example in certain kind of
         programs which require it in case of routines without parameters). 

       Remedy:
         This is just an informational message. 


17663  0-INFO Inserting an actual rout declaration 

       Cause:
         The translation process is automatically inserting the appropriate
         ROUTINE, BEGIN, and END statements of a routine that has already
         been declared as EXPORTED FROM. 

       Remedy:
         This is just an informational message. 


17664  0-INFO Successful EOF reached 


17665  0-INFO Invalid argument to CALLS 


17666  0-INFO Specify STRING length for local vars & fields 

       Cause:
         The * notation for the STRING length can only be used in program
         variable declarations.  All routine STRING declarations and STRING
         fields in user-defined types must include a length specification. 

       Remedy:
         Change the * to a valid STRING length. 


17667  0-INFO Specify STRING length as for ARRAY sizes 

       Cause:
         The * notation for the STRING length cannot be used in an ARRAY
         declaration if the ARRAY sizes are specified.  The following
         example will cause this error since the ARRAY size is specified and
         the STRING length is not. - -  -- Error since array size is
         specified -  VAR myvar : ARRAY[5] OF STRING[*] 

       Remedy:
         Change the * to a valid STRING length. 


17668  0-INFO Can't specify STRING length with no ARRAY dims 

       Cause:
         The * notation for the STRING length MUST be used in an ARRAY
         declaration if the * notation is used for the ARRAY sizes.  The
         following example will cause this error since the ARRAY size is not
         specified and the STRING length is. - -  -- Error since array size
         is not specified -  VAR myvar : ARRAY[*] OF STRING[5] 

       Remedy:
         Replace actual STRING length specification with an *. 


17669  0-INFO Built-in not permitted as a cond or action 

       Cause:
         Only the built-in routines referenced in the "Condition Handlers"
         chapter can be used as a condition handler condition or action. 
         All other built-in routines are disallowed. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the built-in call or use one that is permitted in condition
         handlers. 


17670  0-INFO BOOLEAN predefined const expected 

       Cause:
         One of the predefined BOOLEAN constants must be used.  These values
         are TRUE, FALSE, ON, and OFF. 

       Remedy:
         Replace the expression with one of these values. 


17671  0-INFO INTEGER variable or port expected 

       Cause:
         An INTEGER program variable or an INTEGER port reference must be
         used in this type of condition.  The following example will cause
         this error since "myconst" is not a program variable or INTEGER
         port reference. - -  CONST myconst = 89 -  . . . -  BEGIN -   
         CONDITION[3]: -      WHEN BIT_TEST(myconst, 5, TRUE) 

       Remedy:
         Change the reference to be an INTEGER program variable or an
         INTEGER port reference. 


17672  0-INFO Specify ARRAY dims for local vars & fields 

       Cause:
         The * notation for the ARRAY size(s) can only be used in program
         variable declarations.  All routine ARRAY declarations and ARRAY
         fields in user-defined types must include the ARRAY size(s). 

       Remedy:
         Change the * to a valid ARRAY size. 


17673  0-INFO Bad context for sys vars with limits/locking 

       Cause:
         System variables that require internal locking or limit checking
         cannot be used as arguments that are passed by reference.  This
         applies to standard node fields as well. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the reference to the system variable that requires locking
         or limit checking. 


17674  0-INFO STRING literal expected 

       Cause:
         The translation process was expecting a STRING literal but detected
         some other information. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use a STRING literal in the appropriate
         spot. 


17675  0-INFO User id with same name as used built-in 

       Cause:
         This error results when a VAR, CONST, or ROUTINE statement is
         modified or added and it declares a user-defined identifier with
         the same name as a built-in routine which is used in the program. 

       Remedy:
         Choose a different name for the user-defined identifier. 


17676  0-INFO User id with same name as used predef const 

       Cause:
         This error results when a VAR, CONST, or ROUTINE statement is
         modified or added and it declares a user-defined identifier with
         the same name as a predefined constant which is used in the
         program. 

       Remedy:
         Choose a different name for the user-defined identifier. 


17677  0-INFO Maximum number of labels exceeded 

       Cause:
         A program cannot have more than 250 labels.  Statements such as IF,
         SELECT, WHILE, FOR, REPEAT, etc. should be used to eliminate the
         GOTO statements and labels. 

       Remedy:
         Modify the program to avoid exceeding the maximum number of labels. 


17678  0-INFO Maximum number of progs exceeded 

       Cause:
         A program cannot reference more than 249 programs. 

       Remedy:
         Modify the program to avoid exceeding the maximum number of
         referenced programs. 


17679  0-INFO Comment too long 

       Cause:
         A comment exceeded the maximum length of 255. 

       Remedy:
         Use multiple shorter comments instead of one long comment in the
         program. 


17680  0-INFO Sys var cannot be passed by reference 

       Cause:
         System variables are always passed by value to routines.  This
         error occurs when a system variable is used as an argument to a
         built-in routine that expects the argument to be passed by
         reference. 

       Remedy:
         Do not use a system variable as an argument to a built-in routine
         that expects it to be passed by reference.  These types of
         parameters are marked in the manual as [OUT]. 


17681  0-INFO Can only synchronize 2 arms in a MOVE 

       Cause:
         The maximum number of arms that can be synchronized in a single
         MOVE statement is 2.  This error indicates > 2 arms has been
         specified. 

       Remedy:
         Use multiple MOVE statements. 


17682  0-INFO Argument must be an array 

       Cause:
         The argument to the routine must be an array. 

       Remedy:
         Change the argument to be an array. 


17683  0-INFO ADVANCE not permitted on SYNCMOVE 

       Cause:
         The translation process detected an ADVANCE clause in a SYNCMOVE
         section. ADVANCE is only permitted on the MOVE section.  Therefore,
         the ADVANCE is ignored. 

       Remedy:
         If ADVANCE is desired, add it to the MOVE section. 


17684  0-INFO Identifier in increment or decrement assignement must be
       declared 

       Cause:
         The automatic declaration of undefined variables is only permitted
         in regular assignments.  Increment or decrement assignments to
         undefined identifiers cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the identifier name.  If correct, add a
         declaration for the identifier. 


17685  0-INFO Id in incr/decr assignment must be integer program var 

       Cause:
         The left operand of an increment or decrement assignment statement
         must be an integer program variable.  Increment or decrement
         assignments to system variables or non-integer program variables
         will cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the identifier name and it's data type. If
         the correct identifier is used, change the data type to be INTEGER.
         If it is a system variable identifier, use a program variable
         instead. 


17686  0-INFO Expression in incr/decr assignment can't be sys var 

       Cause:
         The increment or decrement amount of an increment or decrement
         assignment action cannot be a system variable.    For example, i +=
         $MOVE_TYPE will cause this error since the increment amount is
         specified as a sytem variable. 

       Remedy:
         Use a program variable or a value instead a system variable for the
         increment or decrement amount. 


17687  0-INFO Invalid incr or decr assignment action 

       Cause:
         An invalid increment or decrement assignment action is detected. 
         This is due to an expression being used for the right operand
         instead of a single variable reference, literal, or constant
         identifier reference.  The following example will cause this error
         since the right operand of the assignment action is an expression.
         - -  VAR a, i : INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -    CONDITION[3]: -     
         WHEN $DIN[4]+ DO -        -- Error since expression is used in the
         action -        a += 4 * i -      . . . -    ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Fix the right operand so that it is a single variable reference, a
         literal, or a constant identifier reference. 


17688  0-INFO SCAN time already specified 

       Cause:
         This warning is detected when the SCAN time option is specified
         more than one time on a CONDITION statement. 

       Remedy:
         Choose the proper scan time option and delete the other(s). 


17689  0-INFO Invalid data type used in type cast 

       Cause:
         The data type specified in the type cast is invalid. Valid data
         types are INTEGER and REAL. Any other data type will cause this
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the data type used in the type cast. 


17690  0-INFO Invalid type cast 

       Cause:
         The data type of the operand cannot be casted to the specified
         type.  Valid casting combinations are: * ** 1: (REAL) int_exp ** 2:
         (REAL) bool_exp ** 3: (INTEGER) real_exp ** 4: (INTEGER) bool_exp *
         Any other data type combination will cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the casted expression. 


17691  0-INFO Ignoring redundant casting 

       Cause:
         This warning is detected when the data type used in the type cast
         is identical to that of the casted expression. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy required since it is automatically ignored. 


17692  0-INFO Invalid type cast in a condition 

       Cause:
         This error is detected because the data type or the operand used in
         a type casting operation within a condition is invalid. Valid
         casting combinations in a condition are: * ** 1: (REAL) int_var **
         2: (REAL) int_exp ** 3: (REAL) int_port[n] ** 4: (INTEGER) real_var
         ** 5: (INTEGER) real_exp * Any other data type and operand
         combination will cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the casted condition expression. 


17693  0-INFO Invalid type cast of ports in condition 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when both operands of a relational condition
         are type casted ports or when a port is type casted and then
         compared with a different typed operand.  When both operands are
         ports, only one of them can be type casted.  When a port is casted,
         it must be compared to a variable or value of the type casting data
         type. For example, the following two WHEN clauses will cause this
         error: - -  VAR i : INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -    CONDITION[3]: - 
         -- error since type casting port to real but comparing it to an
         integer -      WHEN i > (REAL) $AIN[4] DO -        . . . -      --
         error since type casting 2 port operands -      WHEN (REAL) $AIN[7]
         > (REAL) $AIN[4] DO -        . . . -    ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Fix the casted condition expression. 


17694  0-INFO Invalid type cast used in action 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when type casting is improperly used in an
         assignment action.  Ports and boolean variables cannot be type
         casted. For example, the following two actions will cause this
         error: - -  VAR i : INTEGER -    b : BOOLEAN -  . . . -  BEGIN -   
         CONDITION[3]: -      WHEN i > 34 DO -      -- error since type
         casting port in an action -        i := (INTEGER) $DIN[2] -      --
         error since type casting boolean variable in an action -        i
         := (INTEGER) b -    ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Fix the casted expression in the assignment action. 


17695  0-INFO Cannot have multi assignment statement as action 

       Cause:
         The multi-targeted assignment statement is not permitted as an
         action. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the statement from the condition handler. 


17696  0-INFO Diff typed targets in multi assignment statement 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the left operands of a multi-targeted
         assignment statement are not the same data type. It also occurs
         when the left operands are arrays but they do not have the same
         number of dimensions. The left operands must all be the exact same
         type. For example, "int_var := real_var := 6" will cause this error
         since "int_var" and "real_var" are different data types. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the left operands of the statement to be the same data type or
         use separate statements for each group of different types. 


17697  0-INFO Invalid target in multiple assignment statement 

       Cause:
         It is invalid to use a system variable, port, predefined node field
         or a node as the target of a multi-targeted assignment statement.
         The following examples will cause this error. - -      $MOVE_TYPE
         := myvar := LINEAR -      myvar := mypath.NODE[3].$COND_MASK := 34
         -      myvar := $GOUT[3] := 7 

       Remedy:
         Remove the invalid targets from the statement and use separete
         assignments for each invalid target. 


17698  0-INFO Statement cannot be in DISABLE INTERRUPT block 

       Cause:
         Not all PDL2 statements can be issued while interrupts are
         disabled.  This error occurs when such a statement is included in
         the DISABLE INTERRUPT block statement.  Routine calls are also
         disallowed. 

       Remedy:
         Move the statement outside of the DISABLE INTERRUPT block. 


17699  0-INFO Inserting ENABLE INTERRUPT 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENABLE INTERRUPT to
         terminate a DISABLE INTERRUPT statement block.  This warning
         indicates the appropriate ENABLE INTERRUPT statement is
         automatically added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17700  0-INFO Cannot use a TIL clause in SYNCMOVE 

       Cause:
         The TIL clause cannot be used in a SYNCMOVE. 

       Remedy:
         Move the TIL clause to the MOVE section or remove the TIL clause. 


17701  0-INFO Invalid or missing data type specification 

       Cause:
         The data type for a variable or constant is either missing or
         invalid. The VAR statements in the following example would cause
         this error to occur since the data type is missing in the first one
         and a misspelled type in the second: - -  VAR MyVar : -  VAR TimVar
         : INTGR 

       Remedy:
         Indicate a proper data type. 


17702  0-INFO Illegal statement 

       Cause:
         The statement is invalid.  This error occurs when the statement
         does not follow proper PDL2 syntax rules. 

       Remedy:
         Use proper syntax for the statement. 


17703  0-INFO

17799  0-INFO Invalid Unicode string <stringa> 

       Cause:
         The specified Unicode string is invalid. Unicode strings are
         defined with double quotes. 

       Remedy:
         Define the correct unicode string. 


17800  0-INFO Unicode specification invalid in string 

       Cause:
         In the Double quoted string literal there is invalid characters or
         the length of the string is not even. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the contents of the string. 


17801  0-INFO Condition expression not supported 

       Cause:
         The condition expression such as $BREG[1]+ is not supported so the
         statement has been changed. 

       Remedy:
         A warning but take note of it as it does change the behaviour of
         the condition. 


17802  4-PAUSE %s(%d): builtin does not support symbolic dereferencing 

       Cause:
         The paramater to the builtin is in the form of a symbolic
         dereference but this builtin does not support it. 

       Remedy:
         Check with the manual as to builtin parameters. 


17803  0-INFO Bad XML value specified 

       Cause:
         The <value> field in the XML field is incorrect. 

       Remedy:
         Check the type of Value specified. 


17804  0-INFO System variable deprecated 

       Cause:
         The system variable being access is deprecated. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to use a new / non-deprecated variable. 


17805  0-INFO CASE limit reached 

       Cause:
         The CASE statement can only support upto 8 ranges within one CASE
         statement. For example CASE
         (1..2,10..12,20..22,30..32,101..102,110..112,120..122,130..132,1000.
         .1001): 

       Remedy:
         If possible move the range expressions to the start of the CASE
         clause and the values at the end. 


17806  0-INFO CASE range invalid 

       Cause:
         The range specified in the CASE statement is invalid as the lower
         index is greater than upper index For example CASE (2..1): 

       Remedy:
         Make sure lower value preceeds upper value. 


17807  0-INFO Missing CATCH/FINAL clause 

       Cause:
         A TRY..ENDTRY statement does not have any CATCH or FINAL clauses.
         This is an empty TRY statement. 

       Remedy:
         Add the appropriate CATCH or FINAL clauses or delete the
         TRY..ENDTRY statement. 


17808  0-INFO Inserting ENDTRY 

       Cause:
         The translation process did not get an ENDTRY to terminate a TRY
         statement.  This warning indicates the appropriate ENDTRY is
         automatically being added. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy since it is automatically fixed. 


17809  0-INFO Only one CATCH: all clause allowed and must be last clause 

       Cause:
         Only one CATCH: all is allowed per TRY .. ENDTRY statement and must
         be last clause. 

       Remedy:
         Check that only one CATCH has been defined and is the last CATCH
         clause. 


17810  0-INFO Invalid BREAK/CONTINUE statement 

       Cause:
         The specified BREAK / CONTINUE is not valid in the current context. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the BREAK / CONTINUE is within the correct level of FOR,
         WHILE and REPEAT loops. 


17811  0-INFO 


17905  0-INFO SYSTEM ERROR: Import already exists

18433  0-INFO Not enough memory 

       Cause:
         The editor ran out of free memory. 

       Remedy:
         Suspend from the editor and erase all unnecessary data from memory. 


18434  0-INFO File cannot be accessed 

       Cause:
         The specified file cannot be accessed using the editor. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the file name was properly entered. 


18435  0-INFO File not found 

       Cause:
         The specified file does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the file name was properly entered. 


18436  0-INFO Editor command not available 

       Cause:
         The editor command is not available. 

       Remedy:
         Informational message. 


18437  0-INFO Application aid prog not ready 

       Cause:
         The application program is not ready.  This means it is not waiting
         for the application aid editor command. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the application program is activated and that it contains
         a condition handler or WAIT FOR statement using the application aid
         EVENT condition. 


18438  0-INFO 


18439  0-INFO 


18440  0-INFO Length exceeded, line will be truncated 

       Cause:
         The editor currently has a maximum line length of 132 characters. 
         When this is exceeded the line is truncated. Another cause of this
         error is when the Filer Edit command is issued and a line in the
         file is longer than 65535 characters. 

       Remedy:
         Break the long line into multiple shorter lines that do not exceed
         132 characters. If the error is caused by Filer Edit, do not exceed
         65535 characters. 


18441  0-INFO 


18442  0-INFO Cannot delete this stmt 

       Cause:
         The program editor does not permit statements to be deleted if they
         cause an error in the program.  For example, the ENDIF statement
         cannot be deleted because it is needed for the matching IF
         statement.  This error will be detected if the user tries to delete
         the ENDIF statement. 

       Remedy:
         In order to delete statements like the ENDIF, the entire matching
         statement must be deleted.  For example, the entire IF statement
         has to be deleted in order to remove the ENDIF.  However, some
         statements can never be deleted.  For example, the BEGIN of the
         main program cannot be deleted because it is absolutely required. 


18443  0-INFO New stmt not compatible with old, not replaced 

       Cause:
         The program editor does not permit a statement to be modified into
         a different type of statement if it causes errors in the program. 
         For example, an ENDIF statement cannot be changed into an ENDFOR
         statement because the matching IF statement requires an ENDIF.  If
         such a change is detected by the program editor, this error will be
         detected and the modifications will not be made. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the desired modifications and make sure they do not create
         errors in existing statements. 


18444  0-INFO Not enough memory for CUT/DELETE buffer 

       Cause:
         The editor does not have enough memory to allocate a new CUT/DELETE
         buffer large enough to hold the selected section of the file. 

       Remedy:
         Suspend from the editor and erase all unnecessary data from memory.
         Another solution is to perform several CUT/PASTE operations using
         smaller sections of the file.  Smaller sections means a smaller
         CUT/DELETE buffer is needed. 


18445  0-INFO Var used, cannot delete dcl 

       Cause:
         This error results when a VAR statement is either being CUT or
         DELETED and the VAR statement contains variables which are
         referenced in the program. 

       Remedy:
         Each variable used in the program must be declared in a VAR
         statement. Therefore, those VAR statements cannot be removed from
         the program. If the unused variables are to be removed from the
         declarations section, use the UNUSED command.  This command will
         delete the declarations of all unused variables. 


18446  0-INFO Const used, cannot delete dcl 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when a constant declaration statement is
         either being CUT or DELETED and the constant declared in the
         statement is referenced in the program.  The constant might be used
         in a variable or type declaration or in an executable section of
         the program.  Any such reference will cause this error to be
         detected. 

       Remedy:
         Each constant used in the program must be declared in a CONST
         statement. Therefore, those statements cannot be removed from the
         program.  Either eliminate all references to the constant before
         deleting the declaration statement or do not delete the declaration
         statement. 


18447  0-INFO Routine used, cannot delete dcl 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a routine declaration is either being CUT or
         DELETED and the routine declared in the statement is referenced in
         the program. 

       Remedy:
         Each routine used in the program must be declared before its usage.
         Therefore, those routine declaration statements cannot be removed
         from the program.  Either eliminate all references to the routine
         before deleting the declaration statement or do not delete the
         declaration statement. 


18448  0-INFO Record used, cannot delete dcl 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a user-defined type declaration statement is
         either being CUT or DELETED and the type declared in the statement
         is referenced in the program.  The type might be used in a variable
         or routine declaration. Any such reference will cause this error to
         be detected. 

       Remedy:
         Each user-defined type used in the program must be declared in a
         TYPE statement. Therefore, those statements cannot be removed from
         the program.  Either eliminate all references to the type before
         deleting the declaration statement or do not delete the declaration
         statement. 


18449  0-INFO Field used, cannot delete dcl 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a field declaration statement of a
         user-defined type is either being CUT or DELETED and a field
         declared in the statement is referenced in the program. 

       Remedy:
         Each user-defined field referenced in the program must be declared
         in a user-defined type declaration statement. Therefore, those
         statements cannot be removed from the program.  Either eliminate
         all references to the field before deleting the declaration
         statement or do not delete the declaration statement. 


18450  0-INFO Var used, data type cannot be changed 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the data type of a variable which is
         referenced in the program is modified.  For example, if the
         variable "pippo" is referenced and is currently declared as a
         STRING, the variable declaration of "pippo" cannot be changed to
         make "pippo" any other data type.  However, if "pippo" is not
         referenced in the program such a modification is permitted.  The
         program editor permits size modifications to a variables data type
         even if it is referenced in the program.  For example, even if
         "pippo" is reference, the STRING length can be changed since that
         doesn't change the actual data type of the variable. 

       Remedy:
         Either remove all references to the variable before changing its
         data type or don't change the data type.  If the data type of a
         variable needs to be changed, comment out the statements
         referencing the variable so they are not actually deleted from the
         program.  Then uncomment them after the data type has been changed. 


18451  0-INFO Const used, data type cannot be changed 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the value of a constant which is referenced
         in the program is modified such that it now has a different data
         type.  For example, if the constant "pippo" is referenced and is
         currently declared having a value of 3, the constant declaration of
         "pippo" cannot be changed to make it have any value other than an
         INTEGER value.  However, if "pippo" is not referenced in the
         program such a modification is permitted.  The program editor
         permits value modifications to a constant even if it is referenced
         in the program as long as the new constant value has the same data
         type as the old constant value. 

       Remedy:
         Either remove all references to the constant before changing its
         data type or don't change the data type.  If the data type of a
         constant needs to be changed, comment out the statements
         referencing the constant so they are not actually deleted from the
         program.  Then uncomment them after the data type has been changed. 


18452  0-INFO Command not allowed in TEXT mode 

       Cause:
         Certain editor commands are only available while editing a PDL2
         program as opposed to editing a text file.  This error results when
         such a command is issued while editing a text file. 

       Remedy:
         Don't issue commands not permitted in TEXT mode or switch to using
         the program editor. 


18453  0-INFO Prog name cannot be changed 

       Cause:
         The name of the program must match the name of the file.  If the
         program name is modified to be different this error is detected. 

       Remedy:
         Do not change the program name. 


18454  0-INFO Id not found in this context 

       Cause:
         The identifier name specified in the RENAME command is not declared
         within the current context.  Context is determined by the current
         cursor position. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the identifier name. 


18455  0-INFO Id has already been declared 

       Cause:
         The new name for the identifier being RENAMED is already declared
         in the current context. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the new name or choose a different new name. 


18456  0-INFO Not allowed during MARK command 

       Cause:
         Some editor commands are not permitted while MARK is in progress. 
         This error is detected when such a command is issued while MARK is
         currently active.  For example, a line cannot be deleted while MARK
         is active. If the DELETE LINE command is issued while MARK is
         active, this error will be detected. 

       Remedy:
         Finish the CUT/COPY operation or turn MARK off before issuing the
         command. 


18457  0-INFO CUT buffer is empty 

       Cause:
         If the PASTE operation is performed before anything is put in the
         CUT buffer, this error is detected.  A CUT or COPY command must be
         issued before the PASTE command. 

       Remedy:
         CUT or COPY the appropriate section of the file into the CUT buffer
         before issuing the PASTE command. 


18458  0-INFO Must MARK lines before doing CUT/COPY 

       Cause:
         A section of the file must be MARKed before issuing the CUT or COPY
         command. 

       Remedy:
         Turn MARK on by issuing the MARK command and select the appropriate
         section of the file before issuing the CUT or COPY command. 


18459  0-INFO 


18460  0-INFO Command not allowed in CODE mode 

       Cause:
         Some program editor commands are not permitted while in CODE mode.
         This error is detected when such a command is issued and the
         program editor is in CODE mode. 

       Remedy:
         Exit CODE mode before issuing the command. 


18461  0-INFO Cannot enter DATA mode, edit prog active 

       Cause:
         The program editor cannot enter DATA mode if the program being
         edited is currently executing. 

       Remedy:
         Either don't enter DATA mode or suspend the editor and deactivate
         the program before entering into DATA mode. 


18462  0-INFO Cannot edit outside execution area in this mode 

       Cause:
         The declaration section of a program or routine cannot be edited
         while in DATA/DEBUG/IDE edit mode.  This is not permitted because
         the program is linked to the variables and imported routines
         currently loaded in memory.  Editing a program cannot alter those
         links, therefore, the program editor does not permit the
         modification of any declaration statement while in this edit
         modality. 

       Remedy:
         Exit DATA/DEBUG/IDE mode for making the modification. 


18463  0-INFO Command not allowed in DATA mode 

       Cause:
         Some program editor commands are not permitted while in DATA mode.
         This error is detected when such a command is issued and the
         program editor is in DATA mode. 

       Remedy:
         Exit DATA mode before issuing the command. 


18464  0-INFO Var not found in this context 

       Cause:
         The variable name specified in order to be displayed is not
         declared within the current context, which is determined by the
         cursor position. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the variable name and the context of the
         cursor. 


18465  0-INFO Context must be in the main prog 

       Cause:
         When continuing execution of the program from within the editor,
         the context of the statement to be executed next must be the same
         as the context of the last statement that was executed.  This error
         is detected when the context of the last executed statement was the
         main program but the current cursor position is inside a routine. 

       Remedy:
         Execution must continue with a statement in the main program.
         Therefore, move the cursor to the main program and reissue the RUN
         command. 


18466  0-INFO Cannot mark declaration in DATA mode 

       Cause:
         The declaration section of a program or routine cannot be marked
         while in DATA mode.  This is not permitted because the program is
         linked to the variables and imported routines currently loaded in
         memory.  Editing a program cannot alter those links so the program
         editor does not permit the modification of any declaration
         statement while in DATA mode. Therefore, marking of the declaration
         is also not permitted. 

       Remedy:
         Exit DATA mode before making the modification. 


18467  0-INFO Cannot mark this stmt 

       Cause:
         The program editor does not permit all statements to be marked. 
         For example, the BEGIN and END of the main program or a routine are
         not permitted to be marked. Other statements cannot be marked
         depending upon the direction of the mark.  For example, the ENDIF
         statement cannot be marked in a downward direction because it would
         cause the IF statement to become an error.  Likewise, the IF
         statement cannot be marked in an upward direction because it would
         cause the ENDIF statement to become an error.   Marking in these
         situations causes this error to be detected. 

       Remedy:
         Some statements cannot be marked under any circumstances so there
         is no remedy.  However, for statements like IF and ENDIF the entire
         statement must be marked which means marking must begin either
         before the IF and head in a downward direction or after the ENDIF
         and head in an upward direction. 


18468  0-INFO Id used, cannot cut dcl 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a CUT command is performed and a declaration
         statement is marked declaring a variable, constant, type, field,
         etc. that is currently used in the program. Any statement declaring
         an identifier that is referenced in the program cannot be CUT from
         the program. 

       Remedy:
         Each identifier used in the program must be declared in an
         appropriate declaration statement. Therefore, those declaration
         statements cannot be removed from the program. Either eliminate all
         references to the identifiers before cutting the declaration
         statements or do not include the declaration statements in the CUT
         operation. 


18469  0-INFO Cannot execute stmt in this context 

       Cause:
         This error occurs if the cursor is on a non-executable statement
         when the RUN command is issued.  For example, a VAR statement
         cannot be executed and will cause this error to be detected. 

       Remedy:
         Move the cursor to a valid executable statement before issuing the
         RUN command. 


18470  0-INFO Cannot enter DATA, check state selector 

       Cause:
         The program editor cannot enter DATA mode if the program being
         edited is a holdable program and the system is not in the PROGR
         state. 

       Remedy:
         Either don't enter DATA mode or check the state selector on the
         controller and on the teach pendant to be sure the system is in the
         PROGR state before entering into DATA mode. 


18471  0-INFO Context must be in routine <rout_id> 

       Cause:
         When continuing execution of the program from within the editor,
         the context of the next executed statement must be the same as the
         context of the last statement executed.  This error is detected
         when the context of the last executed statement was the specified
         routine but the current cursor position is inside a different
         routine or the main program. 

       Remedy:
         Execution must continue with a statement in the specified routine.
         Therefore, move the cursor to a statement within the specified
         routine and reissue the RUN command. 


18472  0-INFO Cannot enter DATA mode with a PLC prog 

       Cause:
         The program editor cannot enter DATA mode if the program being
         edited is a PLC program (i.e. the PLC attribute is on the PROGRAM
         statement). 

       Remedy:
         Either don't enter DATA mode or remove the PLC attribute before
         entering into DATA mode. 


18473  0-INFO Cannot use reserved words for id names 

       Cause:
         The new name for the identifier being RENAMED is a reserved word. A
         reserved word cannot be used for any user-defined meaning. 

       Remedy:
         Check the spelling of the new name or choose a different new name. 


18474  0-INFO WARNING: Not enough free memory 

       Cause:
         The editor is running low on memory.  This is a warning so memory
         can be freed up before it is needed for an important command. 

       Remedy:
         Suspend from the editor and erase all unnecessary data from memory. 


18475  0-INFO 


18476  0-INFO Exec must start at line <line_num> 

       Cause:
         Execution cannot be started in the middle of certain multi-lined
         statements.  Instead, execution must begin with the first line of
         the multi-lined statement and continue until the end of such a
         statement is reached.  This error is detected when the RUN command
         is issued for a line in the middle of such a multi-lined statement.
         For example, execution cannot begin at an action of a condition
         handler statement. Instead, it must begin at the CONDITION
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         Move the cursor to the first line of the multi-lined statement and
         begin execution there. 


18477  0-INFO Global pos vars not found on this stmt 

       Cause:
         The MODIFY command can only be applied to a POSITION, JOINTPOS, or
         XTNDPOS variable reference.  This error is detected when the MODIFY
         key is pressed and the current line (indicated by the cursor) does
         not contain such a variable. 

       Remedy:
         Move the cursor to a line containing a reference to the appropriate
         POSITION, JOINTPOS, or XTNDPOS variable to be modified before
         hitting the MODIFY key. 


18478  0-INFO Not allowed, line <line_num> in execution chain 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when a command is issued on a line that is
         currently in the execution chain of the program.  For example, if
         the program is being executed in a routine, the statement
         containing the call to that routine is in the execution chain. 
         Therefore, that statement cannot be deleted, modified, etc. 

       Remedy:
         The program must either be deactivated or executed until the
         statement is no longer in the execution chain before the operation
         can be performed. 


18479  0-INFO Maximum local var size exceeded 

       Cause:
         The maximum amount of memory permitted for local variables of a
         routine is 65535 bytes.  This error is detected when entering DATA
         mode if the maximum space is exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Eliminate unnecessary local variables. 


18480  0-INFO Could not import rout/types/vars from prog 

       Cause:
         The IMPORT command was not completed either due to an error or
         because there was nothing in memory to import. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the items to be imported are actually loaded in memory
         before issuing the IMPORT command.  If necessary, suspend the
         editor and load the appropriate programs and/or variables. 


18481  0-INFO Var used,declaration for <var_id> not deletable 

       Cause:
         This error occurs  when a VAR statement is modified to exclude the
         declaration of the specified variable which is referenced in the
         program. 

       Remedy:
         Each variable used in the program must be declared in a VAR
         statement. Therefore, those declaration of referenced variables
         cannot be removed from the program. If the unused variables are to
         be removed from the declaration section, use the UNUSED command. 
         This command will delete the declarations of all unused variables. 


18482  0-INFO In external rout, line <line_num> 

       Cause:
         This error indicates that the next line to be executed is in an
         external routine.  Execution must continue at the specified line
         number. 

       Remedy:
         The CONTINUE command must be used to continue execution when it
         stops while in an external routine. 


18483  0-INFO Type mismatch for vars of <prog_id>, not loaded 

       Cause:
         This occurs when variables are to be saved because they were
         modified during the edit session but the .VAR file was not
         completely loaded due to a type mismatch during the load process. 

       Remedy:
         You can either keep the old .VAR file or continue to save over it. 


18484  0-INFO PDL2 stmt is too long 

       Cause:
         The editor currently has a maximum line length of 132 characters. 
         When this is exceeded while generating a statement using the
         statement writing aid features of the editor, this error is
         detected. 

       Remedy:
         Break the long line into multiple shorter lines that do not exceed
         132 characters. 


18485  0-INFO Field is used, data type cannot be changed 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the data type of a field which is referenced
         in the program is modified.  For example, if the field "pippo" is
         referenced and is currently declared as a STRING, the field
         declaration of "pippo" cannot be changed to make "pippo" any other
         data type.  However, if "pippo" is not referenced in the program
         such a modification is permitted.  The program editor permits size
         modifications to the data type of a field even if it is referenced
         in the program.  For example, even if "pippo" is reference, the
         STRING length can be changed since that doesn't change the actual
         data type of the field. 

       Remedy:
         Either remove all references to the field before changing its data
         type or don't change the data type.  If the data type of a field
         needs to be changed, comment out the statements referencing the
         field so they are not actually deleted from the program.  Then
         uncomment them after the data type has been changed. 


18486  0-INFO Type used, cannot delete dcl 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a user-defined type declaration statement is
         either being CUT or DELETED and the type declared in the statement
         is referenced in the program.  The type might be used in a variable
         or routine declaration. Any such reference will cause this error to
         be detected. 

       Remedy:
         Each user-defined type used in the program must be declared in a
         TYPE statement. Therefore, those statements cannot be removed from
         the program.  Either eliminate all references to the type before
         deleting the declaration statement or do not delete the declaration
         statement. 


18487  0-INFO Field used, declaration for <field_id> not deletable 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a field declaration is either being CUT or
         DELETED and a field declared in the statement is referenced in the
         program. 

       Remedy:
         Each field referenced with a variable of the owning user-defined
         type in the program must be declared. Therefore, those field
         declaration statements cannot be removed from the program.  Either
         eliminate all references to the field before deleting the
         declaration statement or do not delete the declaration statement. 


18488  0-INFO Vars modified for prog <prog_id>, vars were not loaded 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the variables are to be saved because they
         were modified during the edit session but they were never loaded
         from the .VAR file. 

       Remedy:
         You can either keep the old .VAR file or continue to save over it. 


18489  0-INFO Not allowed while edit prog active 

       Cause:
         Certain editor commands are only available while the program being
         edited is not executing.  This error results when such a command is
         issued while the program is currently active. 

       Remedy:
         Deactivate the program before issuing the command. 


18490  0-INFO Command not allowed in DEBUG mode 

       Cause:
         Certain editor commands are not available while in the MEMORY DEBUG
         environment as opposed to the PROGRAM EDIT environment.  This error
         results when such a command is issued while in DEBUG mode. 

       Remedy:
         Do not issue commands not permitted in DEBUG mode or switch to
         using the program editor. 


18491  0-INFO Application aid prog has finished 

       Cause:
         This is detected when the application aid program terminates. 

       Remedy:
         Either restart the application aid program or don't issue the
         application aid command. 


18492  0-INFO 


18493  0-INFO Not allowed, multi-lined stmt in execution chain 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when a command is issued on a line that is
         part of a multi-lined statement (like a CONDITION..ENDCONDITION,
         OPEN..ENDOPEN, or MOVE..ENDMOVE) currently in the execution chain
         of the program.  For example, the next statement to be executed is
         considered in the execution chain of the program.  In addition, if
         the program is being executed in a routine, the statement
         containing the call to that routine is in the execution chain. 
         Since these types of statements must be executed from beginning to
         end without modifications, any line of such a statement cannot be
         deleted, modified, etc. 

       Remedy:
         Before the operation can be performed, the program must either be
         deactivated or executed until the corresponding ENDxxx statement is
         executed. 


18494  0-INFO Unknown application aid code 

       Cause:
         An invalid value has been specified in the application aid request
         built-in.  This involves a call to the APPL_REQ built-in from the
         application aid program currently being executed.  It has nothing
         to do with the file currently being edited. 

       Remedy:
         Check the application aid program to be sure all requests use valid
         codes. 


18495  0-INFO Line number not found 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when the line number parameter in an
         application aid request does not exist in the program. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the application aid program uses a valid line number
         parameter for the APPL_REQ calls. 


18496  0-INFO Error node stmt 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when the statement being inserted by the
         application aid program produces an error line. 

       Remedy:
         The application aid program should handle this. 


18497  0-INFO Bad import parameter 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when the import parameter to the IMPORT
         application aid request is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the application aid program uses a valid parameter for
         the IMPORT APPL_REQ call. 


18498  0-INFO DELETE buffer is empty 

       Cause:
         If the UNDELETE operation is performed before the DELETE operation,
         the DELETE buffer will be empty and this error is detected.  A
         DELETE command must be issued before the UNDELETE command. 

       Remedy:
         DELETE a statement so the DELETE buffer is no longer empty. 


18499  0-INFO Application aid not active 

       Cause:
         The application aid program is not active. 

       Remedy:
         Suspend the editor and activate the appropriate application aid
         program. 


18500  0-INFO Var prefix cannot be greater than 3 char 

       Cause:
         The prefix for the variable name used when the REC button is
         pressed cannot be greater than 3 characters in length.  This error
         is detected when the REC button is setup. 

       Remedy:
         Change the prefix to something having at most 3 characters. 


18501  0-INFO Bad trajectory value 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when the trajectory parameter to the REC key
         setup application aid request is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the application aid program uses a valid trajectory
         parameter for the REC key setup APPL_REQ call. 


18502  0-INFO 


18503  0-INFO Bad line number 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when the line number specified in the GOTO
         line command is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Use a valid line number (> 0). 


18504  0-INFO Bad application aid parameter 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when a parameter to the application aid
         request is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the application aid program uses valid parameters for the
         APPL_REQ call. 


18505  0-INFO Read only file, no write access allowed 

       Cause:
         A file may be given a read only attribute which means even if it is
         modified while being edited, it cannot be saved. 

       Remedy:
         Do not modify the file or change the file attribute before entering
         the editor. 


18506  0-INFO Unrecoverable error, canceling edit session 

       Cause:
         The editor has detected an unrecoverable error.  The edit session
         is automatically canceled. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


18507  0-INFO Error returning to old program 

       Cause:
         If the editor cannot enter the program specified in the NEW
         command, it tries to return to the program previously active in the
         MEMORY DEBUG environment before the NEW command was issued.  If
         there is a problem returning to that program, this error is
         detected.  This problem could be due to a system state change or if
         the program was removed from memory. 

       Remedy:
         Exit and reenter the MEMORY DEBUG environment. 


18508  0-INFO Not allowed, context in external rout 

       Cause:
         Some editor commands are not permitted while execution of the
         program is currently in the context of an external routine.  This
         error is detected when such a command is issued. 

       Remedy:
         Let program execution continue until the execution returns to the
         code contained in the program being edited or do not issue the
         command. 


18509  0-INFO Vars modified for prog <prog_id> 

       Cause:
         This indicates that variables for the specified program have been
         modified during the edit session. 

       Remedy:
         The variables should be saved. 


18510  0-INFO Type linked to other programs - can't rename 

       Cause:
         The RENAME command will rename the identifier loaded in memory as
         well as renaming the identifier in the file being edited if issued
         while the editor is in DATA mode.  However, the rename cannot take
         place if other programs or variables are linked to the identifier
         being renamed. This error is detected when the RENAME command is
         issued for a user-defined type that is currently linked to other
         loaded programs/data.  Remember that the RENAME only effects the
         file being edited. 

       Remedy:
         Either suspend from the editor and erase the programs and/or
         variables linked to the type or enter CODE mode before issuing the
         RENAME command. 


18511  0-INFO Var linked to other programs - can't rename 

       Cause:
         The RENAME command will rename the identifier loaded in memory as
         well as renaming the identifier in the file being edited if issued
         while the editor is in DATA mode.  However, the rename cannot take
         place if other programs or variables are linked to the identifier
         being renamed. This error is detected when the RENAME command is
         issued for a variable that is currently linked to other loaded
         programs.  Remember that the RENAME only effects the file being
         edited. 

       Remedy:
         Either suspend from the editor and erase the programs linked to the
         variable or enter CODE mode before issuing the RENAME command. 


18512  0-INFO Routine linked to other programs - can't rename 

       Cause:
         The RENAME command will rename the identifier loaded in memory as
         well as renaming the identifier in the file being edited if issued
         while the editor is in DATA mode.  However, the rename cannot take
         place if other programs or variables are linked to the identifier
         being renamed. This error is detected when the RENAME command is
         issued for a routine that is currently linked to other loaded
         programs.  Remember that the RENAME only effects the file being
         edited. 

       Remedy:
         Either suspend from the editor and erase the programs linked to the
         routine or enter CODE mode before issuing the RENAME command. 


18513  0-INFO Prog linked to other programs - can't rename 

       Cause:
         The RENAME command will rename the identifier loaded in memory as
         well as renaming the identifier in the file being edited if issued
         while the editor is in DATA mode.  However, the rename cannot take
         place if other programs or variables are linked to the identifier
         being renamed. This error is detected when the RENAME command is
         issued for a program that is currently linked to other loaded
         programs.  Remember that the RENAME only effects the file being
         edited. 

       Remedy:
         Either suspend from the editor and erase the programs linked to the
         program or enter CODE mode before issuing the RENAME command. 


18514  0-INFO Var with new name already exists 

       Cause:
         The RENAME command will rename the identifier loaded in memory as
         well as renaming the identifier in the file being edited if issued
         while the editor is in DATA mode.  However, the rename cannot take
         place if an identifier is already loaded in memory using the new
         name. This error is detected when the RENAME command is issued and
         a variable of the new name already exists in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Double check the spelling of the new name or pick a different new
         name. 


18515  0-INFO Routine with new name already exists 

       Cause:
         The RENAME command will rename the identifier loaded in memory as
         well as renaming the identifier in the file being edited if issued
         while the editor is in DATA mode.  However, the rename cannot take
         place if an identifier is already loaded in memory using the new
         name. This error is detected when the RENAME command is issued and
         a routine of the new name already exists in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Double check the spelling of the new name or pick a different new
         name. 


18516  0-INFO Imported var/rout linked to other prog - can't rename owner 

       Cause:
         The RENAME command will rename the identifier loaded in memory as
         well as renaming the identifier in the file being edited if the
         command is issued while the editor is in DATA mode.  However, the
         rename cannot take place if it involves the renaming of a program
         from which variables and/or routines are currently linked to other
         programs loaded in memory. This error is detected when the RENAME
         command is issued for such a program. 

       Remedy:
         Either suspend from the editor and erase the programs linked to the
         program or enter CODE mode before issuing the RENAME command. 


18517  0-INFO Standard node field used, cannot delete dcl 

       Cause:
         This error is detected when a standard node field declaration
         statement of a user-defined type is either being CUT or DELETED and
         a field declared in the statement is referenced in the program. 

       Remedy:
         Each standard node field referenced in the program must be declared
         in the user-defined type declaration statement. Therefore, those
         statements cannot be removed from the program.  Either eliminate
         all references to the standard node field before deleting the
         declaration statement or do not delete the declaration statement.

18519  0-INFO 


18520  0-INFO Command not allowed in DEBUG mode if prog not fully loaded 

       Cause:
         Certain editor commands are not available while in the MEMORY DEBUG
         environment unless the program is loaded with the /FULL option. 
         This error results when such a command is issued while in DEBUG
         mode for a regularly loaded program. 

       Remedy:
         If the command is needed, exit the MEMORY DEBUG environment and
         reload the program with the /FULL option before entering MEMORY
         DEBUG. 


18521  0-INFO Cannot issue MOD for a node without a $MAIN_ field 

       Cause:
         The MOD key was issued for a node which does not have a $MAIN_
         standard node field.  The MOD modifies this field so it is an error
         if one does not exist in the node definition. 

       Remedy:
         Do not issue MOD for a node without a $MAIN_ field. 


18522  0-INFO Wrong declaration 

       Cause:
         The insert of a declaration has failed generating some errors.
         Possible errors could be invalid declaration variable or variable
         already defined. 


18523  0-INFO Hidden file, cannot edit the file 

       Cause:
         A file may be given a hidden attribute which means it cannot be
         edited. 

       Remedy:
         Do not edit the file or change the file attribute before entering
         the editor. 


18524  0-INFO Program must be loaded before this appl request 

       Cause:
         An application aid request other than stop server or refresh around
         the PC has been requested before a program has been loaded into the
         EDIT environment. 

       Remedy:
         Issue the refresh around the PC request to load a program into the
         EDIT environment before issuing any other request. 


18525  0-INFO Cannot enter DATA, exit TEACH environment 

       Cause:
         The program editor cannot enter DATA mode if the MEMORY TEACH
         environment is active on the teach pendant. 

       Remedy:
         Either don't enter DATA mode or exit the MEMORY TEACH environment.
         In addition, if the program is holdable, check the PROGR/AUTO
         switch on the control panel and the AUTO/MANUAL switch on the teach
         pendant to be sure the system is in the PROGR state before entering
         into DATA mode. 


18527  0-INFO Command not allowed in DEBUG/FULL mode 

       Cause:
         Certain editor commands are not available while in the MEMORY DEBUG
         environment with a program that was loaded with the /FULL option.
         This error results when such a command is issued while in
         DEBUG/FULL mode. 

       Remedy:
         Do not issue commands not permitted in DEBUG/FULL mode or switch to
         using the program editor. 


18528  0-INFO Vars can not be removed from memory 

       Cause:
         Use of the Unused command in CODE mode will not remove the program
         variables from memory.  The variables will remain in memory and
         saved to the variable file if the program variables are saved. 

       Remedy:
         If you want the variables removed from memory either switch to DATA
         mode before starting the Unused command, or use the command line
         menus to remove the variables from memory (look at the Memory Erase
         Variables command for more information).

18940  0-INFO Modify the VIA position? 


18941  0-INFO Modify program no longer active 

       Cause:
         The program under MEMORY DEBUG or PROGRAM EDIT in which a motion's
         position is being modified is no longer active. 

       Remedy:
         Re-activate the program. 


18942  0-INFO No active motions on the arm(s) 

       Cause:
         The MOD key was pressed in PROGRAM EDIT or MEMORY DEBUG and no
         motions are currently active on the arm(s) by this program. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the program has issued a motion. 


18943  0-INFO Motion no longer active 

       Cause:
         The motion being MODified under PROGRAM EDIT or MEMORY DEBUG is no
         longer active. 

       Remedy:
         Re-issue the motion. 


18944  0-INFO Arm is in movement 

       Cause:
         User tried to modify a position while the arm was moving. 

       Remedy:
         Release the start or backward button; wait until the arm has
         stopped; then change the position. 


18945  0-INFO Current motion does not apply to this program 

       Cause:
         The user attempted to modify a position of a segment which does not
         apply to this program. 

       Remedy:
         Only motions issued from the PROGRAM EDIT or MEMORY DEBUG program
         can be modified. Either enter MEMORY DEBUG for the program which
         issued the motion or do not attempt to modify the motion. 


18946  0-INFO MOD not valid on MOVE clause 

       Cause:
         User tried to modify a position which does not have an absolute
         destination in that the motion clause was neither TO or VIA. 

       Remedy:
         For this motion clause it is not possible to modify the position.
         Deactivate the segment, change the position using normal MOD, and
         re-execute it. 


18947  0-INFO Bad MOVE state for MOD 

       Cause:
         User tried to modify a position of a move which has a state that
         doesn't permit any change. For example the move was interrupted in
         fly. 

       Remedy:
         Deactivate the segment, change the position and re-execute it. 


18948  0-INFO Destination not taught position 

       Cause:
         User tried to modify a position of a motion for which the specified
         destination is not a variable. 

       Remedy:
         Modification of an active motion can only work if the destination
         position is a program variable.  Modification to a positional
         expression, system variable, or local variable is not permitted.
         For example, "MOVE TO pnt0001p" is acceptable, but "MOVE TO $HOME"
         cannot be modified. 


18949  0-INFO Move not started yet 

       Cause:
         User tried to modify a position and the move has not started yet.
         By doing so, the user is building a move without space and this is
         not logical. 

       Remedy:
         It is necessary to execute at least a little piece of the move
         before the modification is accepted. 


18950  0-INFO TYPE> Enter data type: 


18951  0-INFO REC/MOD key enabled in EDIT/DATA mode only 

       Cause:
         User tried to issue a REC or MOD while not in DATA mode.  These
         teach pendant keys only have effect while in DATA mode or in the
         MEMORY DEBUG environment. 

       Remedy:
         If in the PROGRAM EDIT environment switch to DATA mode by using the
         MODE key. 


18952  0-INFO References are changed 

       Cause:
         The user tried to modify a position with a different $BASE and/or
         $TOOL and/or $UFRAME. 

       Remedy:
         It is necessary to reset $BASE and/or $TOOL and/or $UFRAME . 


18953  0-INFO Command not allowed. Check machine state selector 

       Cause:
         The command is not allowed in the actual state. 

       Remedy:
         Either move the state selector on the correct position or  don't
         issue the command. 


18954  0-INFO MOD canceled by switch to AUTO 

       Cause:
         User switched from programming mode to automatic mode during the
         modification (MOD) or the teaching (REC) of a position.  For
         holdable programs, this means that in this state the MOD/REC
         operation in disabled. 

       Remedy:
         Don't switch to AUTO during a MOD or REC operation.  If the MOD/REC
         is needed, switch back to PROG state and, from edit, reissue the
         MOD/REC action. 


18955  0-INFO Want to save COD file? 


18956  0-INFO Code for prog <prog_id> modified 

       Cause:
         The code for the program has been modified during this editor
         session. 

       Remedy:
         The code should be saved to the  disk if the modifications are
         important. 


18957  0-INFO Code or variables modified and not saved 

       Cause:
         The code or the variables of the program have been modified in
         memory but not saved on the disk. 

       Remedy:
         This is just an informational message.  To determine which files
         have been modified, use the command which view programs in memory
         (e.g. from the Prog page, MVP).  To save them, issue the Save
         commands (Prog page, MS, ...). 


18958  0-INFO 


18959  0-INFO Illegal arm for SYNCMOVE statement 

       Cause:
         The arm specified for the SYNCMOVE statement (stored in
         $TP_SYNC_ARM[2]) is illegal. 

       Remedy:
         Change the value of the $TP_SYNC_ARM[2] system variable using the
         Motion page on the teach pendant. 


18960  0-INFO The file cannot be saved 

       Cause:
         File access has been denied.  The file is held open for write by a
         PDL2 program or system task. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that all files have been closed from PDL2 programs.  The
         only system file that this may occur with is the 'error.log' file. 


18961  0-INFO  Main WITH $PAR =

         Insufficient access for setting the step mode. 

       Remedy:
         Login in with higher access rights. 


18964  0-INFO You may wish to save your modifications. 


18965  0-INFO Program already being edited 

       Cause:
         The program is already being edited in some other edit session. 

       Remedy:
         Close the other edit session. 


18966  0-INFO Arm already attached by edit session 

       Cause:
         The arm has already been attached to another edit session. 

       Remedy:
         Close the other edit session. 


18967  0-INFO Program active on arm 

       Cause:
         A program is already active on this arm. 

       Remedy:

       Cause:
         For the moment programs containing IMPORT clauses cannot be edited. 

       Remedy:
         Use Memory Debug or Filer Edit. 


19001  0-INFO Incorrect setting for $REC_SETUP 

       Cause:
         The setting of $REC_SETUP is not correct. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the contents. 


19002  0-INFO Identifier already declared 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to insert some form of identifier, but the
         identifier already exists. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the identifier does already exist and, if so, then use
         this or create the identifier with a different name. 


19003  0-INFO Insufficient User modify level 

       Cause:
         User has insufficient rights for modifying the code.

20481  0-INFO Program not in memory 

       Cause:
         The specified program is not currently loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Load the program using a proper loading command (Load.., ML). 


20482  0-INFO Program name too long 

       Cause:
         The length of the specified program name is greater than 32. 

       Remedy:
         Shorten the length of the program name. 


20483  0-INFO GST version mismatch 


20484  0-INFO Program table is full 

       Cause:
         The maximum number of programs (250) are loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Erase unnecessary programs from memory. 


20485  0-INFO Program already exists 

       Cause:
         A program having the specified name already exists in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Change the program name. 


20486  0-INFO Invalid program name 

       Cause:
         The specified program name contains invalid characters or does not
         begin with an alphabetical character. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the program name begins with an alphabetical character
         and contains only alphabetical, numeric, or underscore characters. 
         In addition, the maximum length of a program name is 32. 


20487  0-INFO Variable not found 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is not loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the variable name was specified properly or load the
         appropriate variable file into memory. 


20488  0-INFO Variable already exists 

       Cause:
         A variable having the specified name already exists in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Change the variable name. 


20489  0-INFO Invalid variable name 

       Cause:
         The specified variable name contains invalid characters or does not
         begin with an alphabetical character. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the variable name begins with an alphabetical character
         and contains only alphabetical, numeric, or underscore characters. 
         There is no maximum length for variable names. 


20490  0-INFO Invalid program index 


20491  0-INFO Invalid data type 

       Cause:
         An operation has been performed on an invalid data type. For
         example creating an ARRAY of nodes, a PATH of semaphores. 

       Remedy:
         Review the context in which this error happens. 


20492  0-INFO Var linked to loaded prog so can't delete it 

       Cause:
         There are programs loaded in memory which reference the specified
         variable.  Therefore, it cannot be erased from memory. 

       Remedy:
         Erase the programs referencing the specified variable before
         erasing the variable itself. 


20493  0-INFO 


20494  0-INFO 


20495  0-INFO Data type mismatch while loading var <var_id> 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is currently loaded in memory and the data
         type for that variable in memory does not match the data type
         contained in the .VAR or .COD file being loaded.  This is the
         actual data type not the string size, array size, etc. 

       Remedy:
         If the error is the result of loading a .COD file, make sure the
         variable is declared properly in the program. If the value in the
         .VAR file is important and the file contains the proper data type,
         erase the variable from memory and issue the MEMORY LOAD (ML)
         command again.  However, if the data type in memory is proper, the
         .VAR file can be loaded but the value of this particular variable
         will not be loaded from the file. 


20496  0-INFO Export status mismatch on var <var_id> 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is currently loaded in memory and the export
         status information for that variable in memory does not match the
         export status information contained in the .VAR or .COD file being
         loaded. 

       Remedy:
         If the error was detected while loading a .VAR file, the /CONVERT
         option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD (ML/C) command.  This
         option will cause the value to be loaded and the export status to
         be ignored. If the error was detected while loading a .COD file and
         the value is to be maintained, issue a MEMORY SAVE (MS) command to
         save the value of the variables in a file.  Remember that all
         variables for the specified program will be saved.  Issue a MEMORY
         ERASE (ME) command to erase the variable from memory and then load
         the .COD file and if needed, the .VAR file (with the /CONVERT
         option). 


20497  0-INFO Prog code currently in use so can't delete it 

       Cause:
         The program cannot be erased from memory because it is currently
         being used.  This means either it is currently being executed or
         another program is executing one of its routines. 

       Remedy:
         Either don't erase the program or stop all programs from executing
         before issuing the MEMORY ERASE (ME) command. 


20498  0-INFO Predefined constant not found 


20499  0-INFO Predefined variable not found 

       Cause:
         A predefined variable of the given name does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the predefined variable name is spelled correctly. 


20500  0-INFO Program contains errors so cannot load 

       Cause:
         The program contains errors.  A program cannot be loaded into
         memory if it contains errors. 

       Remedy:
         Edit the program and fix all the errors before issuing the MEMORY
         LOAD (ML) command. 


20501  0-INFO Can't load prog - possible corruption of .COD file 

       Cause:
         The loading of a program detected invalid information in the .COD
         file. 

       Remedy:
         Try to restore your backup file. 


20502  0-INFO Load stack overflow 

       Cause:
         The program stack is not big enough for containing the data needed
         by the program. 

       Remedy:
         Try optimizing data (for example local variables declarations
         inside routines) or increase the program stack dimension changing
         the STACK attribute in the PROGRAM header. 


20503  0-INFO Routine not in memory 

       Cause:
         The routine is not currently loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Issue a MEMORY LOAD (ML) command for the program owning the
         routine. 


20504  0-INFO Routine definition mismatch 

       Cause:
         The routine is currently loaded in memory and the definition
         information for that routine in memory does not match the
         definition information contained in the .COD file being loaded. 
         This is due to a mismatch in the function return type. 

       Remedy:
         Double check the routine definition in all programs referencing the
         routine.  Fix the definition in the program containing the
         incorrect routine definition. 


20505  0-INFO Parameter list declaration mismatch 

       Cause:
         The routine is currently loaded in memory and the parameter
         definition information for that routine in memory does not match
         the parameter definition information contained in the .COD file
         being loaded.  This is due to a mismatch in the number of
         parameters or a mismatch in the data type definition of a
         parameter. 

       Remedy:
         Double check the routine definition in all programs referencing the
         routine.  Fix the parameter definition(s) in the program containing
         the incorrect routine definition. 


20506  0-INFO Rout not exported but another prog already imports it 

       Cause:
         A routine owned by the program being loaded into memory is declared
         without an EXPORTED FROM clause.  However, another program is
         currently loaded in memory which imports the routine. 

       Remedy:
         If the routine is supposed to be exported, edit the program and add
         the EXPORTED FROM clause.  If not, erase the program importing the
         routine from memory and issue the MEMORY LOAD (ML) command for the
         owning program again. 


20507  0-INFO NOSAVE, GLOBAL, CONST, NODATA  mismatch on var <var_id> 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is currently loaded in memory and the
         NOSAVE, GLOBAL, CONST, NODATA attribute information for that
         variable in memory does not match the NOSAVE attribute information
         contained in the .COD file being loaded. 

       Remedy:
         If the value is to be maintained, issue a MEMORY SAVE (MS) command
         to save the value of the variables in a file.  Remember that all
         variables for the specified program will be saved. If the NOSAVE
         attribute in the .COD file is incorrect, edit the program (in /CODE
         mode) and change the attribute. Erase the variable from memory and
         then load the .COD file and if needed, the .VAR file. 


20509  0-INFO Var file version stamp mismatch 

       Cause:
         The .VAR file was generated using newer software than what is
         currently loaded on the controller. 

       Remedy:
         Update the controller software. 


20510  0-INFO Error writing to file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred while generating the .VAR, .COD, or .C5G file.
         This is usually caused by not having enough disk space for the new
         file. 

       Remedy:
         Delete all unnecessary files from the disk and reissue the MEMORY
         SAVE (MS) command. 


20511  0-INFO Error reading from file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred while loading the .VAR, .COD, or .C5G file. This
         is usually caused by a corrupted file. 

       Remedy:
         Try to recover a backup file.  If the error occurred while loading
         a .COD file, try generating the ASCII version to recover as much of
         the program as possible. 


20512  0-INFO Error opening var/vps/cio/vtr file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred opening that kind of file. 

       Remedy:
         If this error is the result of loading the file, make sure the file
         exists.  However, if this error is the result of saving the
         variables, there may not be enough disk space for the new file.  In
         this case, delete all unnecessary files from the disk. 


20513  0-INFO Error closing var file 


20514  0-INFO Backup var file reappeared 


20515  0-INFO Error renaming temporary var file 


20516  0-INFO Temporary var file has disappeared 


20517  0-INFO 


20519  0-INFO Invalid .COD file 

       Cause:
         The program file is not a valid .COD file.  This can happen by
         renaming a non-.COD file to a .COD file or it can happen by
         corrupting a valid .COD file. 

       Remedy:
         Locate the proper .COD file and use that file. 


20520  0-INFO Predefined variable type mismatch while loading 

       Cause:
         A predefined variable referenced in the .COD file has a different
         data type specification than the predefined variable defined on the
         controller.  This can occur if the file was corrupted or if the
         data type of a predefined variable has changed from one system
         software release to the next. 

       Remedy:
         There is no remedy if the file is corrupted except to try loading a
         backup file.  If the error results to a system software difference,
         obtain a .PDL file using the system software that was in place at
         the time the .COD file was generated.  Then translate the .PDL file
         using the new system software. 


20525  0-INFO File is not a valid .VAR file 

       Cause:
         The variable file is not a valid .VAR file.  This can happen by
         renaming a non-.VAR file to a .VAR file or it can happen by
         corrupting a valid .VAR file. 

       Remedy:
         Locate the proper .VAR file and load that file. 


20527  0-INFO Var SAVE/LOAD operation aborted 

       Cause:
         CTRL C (^C) was detected during the MEMORY SAVE or MEMORY LOAD of a
         .VAR file. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy.  ^C aborts the operation.  If desired, the operation can
         be resubmitted. 


20528  0-INFO String length <var_id> mismatch 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is currently loaded in memory and the string
         length information for that variable in memory does not match the
         string length information contained in the .VAR or .COD file being
         loaded. 

       Remedy:
         If the error was detected while loading a .VAR file, the /CONVERT
         option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD (ML/C) command.  This
         option will cause the appropriate parts of the mismatched variable
         value to be loaded instead of the entire value. For example, if the
         mismatch was caused because the variable in memory is a STRING
         having a maximum length of 10 and the variable in the file is
         declared as a STRING having a maximum length of 20, only the first
         10 characters of the value in the file will be loaded. If the error
         was detected while loading a .COD file and the value is to be
         maintained, issue a MEMORY SAVE (MS) command to save the value of
         the variables in a file.  Remember that all variables for the
         specified program will be saved.  Issue a MEMORY ERASE (ME) command
         to erase the variable from memory and then load the .COD file and
         if needed, the .VAR file (with the /CONVERT option). 


20529  0-INFO Array size <var_id> mismatch 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is currently loaded in memory and array size
         information for that variable in memory does not match the array
         size information contained in the .VAR or .COD file being loaded. 

       Remedy:
         If the error was detected while loading a .VAR file, the /CONVERT
         option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD (ML/C) command.  This
         option will cause the appropriate parts of the mismatched variable
         value to be loaded instead of the entire value. For example, if the
         mismatch was caused because the variable in memory is a one
         dimensional ARRAY having 10 elements and the variable in the file
         is declared as a one dimensional ARRAY having 20 elements, only the
         first 10 elements of the value in the file will be loaded. If the
         error was detected while loading a .COD file and the value is to be
         maintained, issue a MEMORY SAVE (MS) command to save the value of
         the variables in a file.  Remember that all variables for the
         specified program will be saved.  Issue a MEMORY ERASE (ME) command
         to erase the variable from memory and then load the .COD file and
         if needed, the .VAR file (with the /CONVERT option). 


20530  0-INFO Array dimension <var_id> mismatch 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is currently loaded in memory and the number
         of array dimensions for that variable in memory does not match the
         number of array dimensions contained in the .VAR or .COD file being
         loaded. 

       Remedy:
         The number of array dimensions must match in order to load a .VAR
         or .COD file.  The only way to fix this is to change the
         appropriate file.  If this error resulted from the loading of a
         .VAR file, the remaining variables will be loaded.  Therefore, you
         can load the other variables from a .VAR file even if this error is
         detected. This is an error that cannot be fixed using the /CONVERT
         option. 


20531  0-INFO Arm number <var_id> mismatch 

       Cause:
         The specified variable is currently loaded in memory and the arm
         number information for that variable in memory does not match the
         arm number information contained in the .VAR or .COD file being
         loaded. 

       Remedy:
         If the error was detected while loading a .VAR file, the /CONVERT
         option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD (ML/C) command.  This
         option will cause the appropriate parts of the mismatched variable
         value to be loaded instead of the entire value. For example, if the
         mismatch was caused because the variable in memory is declared for
         arm 1 having 6 axes and the variable in the file is declared for
         arm 2 having 6 axes, the 6 axes values in the file will be loaded
         and arm 1 will be used. If the error was detected while loading a
         .COD file and the value is to be maintained, issue a MEMORY SAVE
         (MS) command to save the value of the variables in a file. 
         Remember that all variables for the specified program will be
         saved.  Issue a MEMORY ERASE (ME) command to erase the variable
         from memory and then load the .COD file and if needed, the .VAR
         file (using the /CONVERT option). 


20532  0-INFO Number of axes <var_id> mismatch 

       Cause:
         The specified arm related variable (either a JOINTPOS or XTNDPOS)
         is currently loaded in memory and the number of axes for that
         variable in memory does not match the number of axes contained in
         the .VAR file being loaded. 

       Remedy:
         Since the error was detected while loading a .VAR file, the
         /CONVERT option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD (ML/C) command. 
         This option will cause the appropriate parts of the mismatched
         variable value to be loaded instead of the entire value. For
         example, if the mismatch was caused because the variable in memory
         is declared for arm 1 having 6 axes and the variable in the file is
         declared for arm 1 having 7 axes, the first 6 axes values in the
         file will be loaded. 


20533  0-INFO Unparsing stack overflow 


20534  0-INFO Unparsing routine stack overflow 


20535  0-INFO Program load has been canceled 

       Cause:
         CTRL C (^C) was detected during the MEMORY LOAD (ML) or PROGRAM GO
         (PG) of a program. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy.  ^C aborts the operation.  If desired, the operation can
         be resubmitted. 


20536  0-INFO Can't delete var while teach environment is active 

       Cause:
         The system will not permit a variable to be erased from memory if
         the teach environment is currently active for the owning program. 

       Remedy:
         Exit the teach environment before erasing the variable. 


20537  0-INFO Can't edit prog because nesting indentation too large 

       Cause:
         The system has a maximum nesting indentation level of 31.  This
         means you cannot have statements nested within statements more than
         31 times.  The types of statements involved are loops, selection,
         condition handler definition, etc.  A program cannot be edited
         using the PDL2 program editor if this maximum is exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Obtain a .PDL file by issuing a FILER TRANSLATE /BACK (FT/B) of the
         .COD file.  Then use the FILER EDIT (FE) command to edit the .PDL
         file.  You will have to issue the FILER TRANSLATE (FT) command to
         obtain a new .COD file after modifying the .PDL file. 


20538  0-INFO Illegal arm number 

       Cause:
         An invalid arm number is used in a variable declaration of a .VAR
         or .COD file being loaded. For example, if the system only has 1
         arm and arm number 2 is used for the declaration of a JOINTPOS
         variable, this is an invalid arm number. 

       Remedy:
         If the error was detected while loading a .COD file, edit the
         program and fix the arm number.  Then load the .COD file again.
         Otherwise, the /CONVERT option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD
         (ML/C) command.  This option will cause the variable containing the
         invalid arm reference to be skipped and the rest of the variables
         in the file will be loaded. If the error occurred while teaching
         (via the MOD key) a positional variable, it is needed to select
         (via the ARM key) the arm declared for that variable before
         pressing again the MOD key. 


20539  0-INFO Illegal SVE index 


20540  0-INFO Out of limit 

       Cause:
         The value specified for a predefined variable is outside the valid
         limits. 

       Remedy:
         Change the value being assigned to the predefined variable to a
         value within the valid limits. 


20541  0-INFO Illegal SVE mode 


20542  0-INFO Data type/attribute mismatch during load 

       Cause:
         The variable is currently loaded in memory and the data type
         information for that variable in memory does not match the data
         type information contained in the .VAR or .COD file being loaded.
         It could be that the actual data types don't match, or it could
         mean that the string size, array sizes/dimensions, arm number, or
         number of axes don't match. 

       Remedy:
         If the error was detected while loading a .VAR file and the error
         was caused by an export status, string length, array size, arm
         number, axes, record type, or node type mismatch, the /CONVERT
         option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD (ML/C) command.  This
         option will cause the appropriate parts of the mismatched variable
         value to be loaded instead of the entire value. For example, if the
         mismatch was caused because the variable in memory is a STRING
         having a maximum length of 10 and the variable in the file is
         declared as a STRING having a maximum length of 20, only the first
         10 characters of the value in the file will be loaded. If the error
         was detected while loading a .COD file and the value is to be
         maintained, issue a MEMORY SAVE (MS) command to save the value of
         the variables in a file.  Remember that all variables for the
         specified program will be saved.  Issue a MEMORY ERASE (ME) command
         to erase the variable from memory and then load the .COD file and
         if needed, the .VAR file (with the /CONVERT option). 


20543  0-INFO Can't load a PLC program 


20544  0-INFO Can't use a reserved word for the program name 

       Cause:
         The name specified for a program is a PDL2 reserved word.  Reserved
         words cannot be used for names of user-defined identifiers. 

       Remedy:
         Choose another name that isn't a PDL2 reserved word.  Refer to the
         PDL2 Language Manual for a list of the reserved words. 


20545  0-INFO Field size too big 

       Cause:
         The maximum size of a field of a user-defined TYPE is 65535 bytes. 
         This has been exceeded by a field defined in a .COD file being
         loaded. 

       Remedy:
         Change the user-defined TYPE and its usage so that all fields are
         smaller than 65536 bytes.  However, be sure the total overall size
         is also smaller than 65536 bytes. 


20546  0-INFO User-defined TYPE not in memory 

       Cause:
         The user-defined TYPE is not currently loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Issue a MEMORY LOAD (ML) command for a program or variable file
         containing a definition of the TYPE. 


20547  0-INFO Total size of record or node TYPE too big 

       Cause:
         The maximum size of a user-defined TYPE is 65535 bytes.  This has
         been exceeded by a TYPE defined in a .COD file being loaded. 

       Remedy:
         Change the user-defined TYPE and its usage so that it is smaller
         than 65536 bytes. 


20548  0-INFO Record/node TYPE <var_id> mismatch 

       Cause:
         This error relates to a record, ARRAY of record, node, or PATH
         variable being reference in a .VAR or .COD file. The variable is
         currently loaded in memory and the user-defined TYPE for that
         variable in memory does not match the user-defined TYPE contained
         in the .VAR or .COD file being loaded.  For example, this error
         occurs if the variable in memory is a record of type "pluto" and it
         is a record of type "pippo" in the file. 

       Remedy:
         If the TYPE definition used in the file is proper, erase the
         variable from memory and reissue the MEMORY LOAD (ML) command. 
         However, if the TYPE in memory is proper, the file must be
         modified.  Therefore, if the error occurred while loading a .COD
         file, edit the program and change the type name.  If the error
         occurred while loading a .VAR file, the remaining variables will be
         loaded from the file and the mismatched variable will not. 


20549  0-INFO Mult arms, required arm num for JNTP/XTND fields 

       Cause:
         If the system has multiple arms defined, an arm specification is
         required on all JOINTPOS and XTNDPOS field definitions of
         user-defined TYPEs.  This error can occur if a .COD file is loaded
         containing such a field without an arm specification. 

       Remedy:
         Edit the program and add an arm specification to the field
         definition. 


20550  0-INFO TYPE has no fields 

       Cause:
         A .COD file is being loaded which contains a user-defined TYPE
         having zero fields.  All user-defined TYPEs must have at least one
         field. 

       Remedy:
         Edit the program and either delete the user-defined TYPE if it is
         not needed or add the appropriate fields to the definition. 


20551  0-INFO Cannot allocate TYPE structure 

       Cause:
         There is not enough memory to create a user-defined TYPE structure
         while loading a .VAR file. 

       Remedy:
         Erase all unnecessary data from memory and reissue the MEMORY LOAD
         (ML) command. 


20552  0-INFO User-defined TYPE description mismatch 

       Cause:
         The definition of a user-defined TYPE currently loaded in memory
         does not match the definition contained in the .VAR or .COD file
         being loaded.  This can occur if the number of fields doesn't
         match, the definition of corresponding fields doesn't match, one is
         a record and the other a node, or the offset of a field doesn't
         match. 

       Remedy:
         If the error was detected while loading a .VAR file, the /CONVERT
         option can be applied to the MEMORY LOAD (ML/C) command.  This
         option will cause the appropriate parts of the value to be loaded
         instead of the entire value.  For example, if the user-defined TYPE
         in memory has an INTEGER field and a REAL field and the
         user-defined TYPE in the file has an INTEGER field, a BOOLEAN
         field, and a REAL field, only the INTEGER and REAL fields will be
         loaded from the file. If the error was detected while loading a
         .COD file and the value is to be maintained, issue a MEMORY SAVE
         (MS) command to save the value of the variables in a file. 
         Remember that all variables for the specified program will be
         saved.  Issue a MEMORY ERASE (ME) command to erase the variable
         from memory and then load the .COD file and if needed, the .VAR
         file (with the /CONVERT option). 


20553  0-INFO Convert table overflow 


20554  0-INFO Bad number of aux axes in xtnd 

       Cause:
         The number of auxiliary axes for an arm is 0 or greater than the
         maximum number permitted by the system.  This means it is invalid
         to define an XTNDPOS variable based on the arm.  If this error
         occurs, the program cannot be loaded in memory and the editor
         cannot enter /DATA mode. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the proper arm is used in the XTNDPOS declaration and
         that the arm is set up with the proper number of auxiliary axes. 


20555  0-INFO Code file protected 

       Cause:

         file, load a program with the /FULL option, deactivate a program,
         or view a loaded program that has been protected. A program is
         protected when the company that wrote the program does not want to
         distribute the source code. 

       Remedy:
         There is no remedy.  The source cannot be displayed and the program
         cannot be deactivated from the command language. 


20556  0-INFO Bad wildcard, must be *... or ...* 

       Cause:
         Several commands permit a wildcard specification as a response to a
         prompt.  This error occurs if an invalid wildcard specification has
         been given.  It could happen if the * character isn't used in the
         wildcard or if the * character does not start or end the
         specification. 

       Remedy:
         Enter a valid wildcard specification. 


20557  0-INFO Wildcard not matched 

       Cause:
         Several commands permit a wildcard specification as a response to a
         prompt.  This error occurs if there are no matches to a wildcard
         specification that has been given.

       Cause:
         This error occurs while a .COD file is being loaded into memory,
         printed, or edited.  It indicates that a BREAK / CONTINUE statement
         has been loaded without being in the correct context. 

       Remedy:
         Verify that the BREAK / CONTINUE statement are correct.

21505  0-INFO Unspecified mantix 

       Cause:
         The exponent of a REAL value has been specified but not the mantix.
         For example,  "E10" instead of  "1.5E10". 

       Remedy:
         All REAL values should have a mantix. Add the mantix to the value. 


21506  0-INFO Unspecified exponent 

       Cause:
         In case of REAL, the mantix and the E exponent have been specified
         without any value after the E. For example,  "2.5E" instead of
         "2.5E10". 

       Remedy:
         Add the value of the exponent to the REAL. 


21507  0-INFO Wrong number of decimal points 

       Cause:
         In the READ value, more decimal points have been specified. 

       Remedy:
         Just a single decimal point is allowed. 


21508  0-INFO Maximum value for the exponent exceeded 

       Cause:
         The exponent of the REAL value is too big. If the value is wrong,
         correct it. If it is correct, this error comes out if it cannot be
         represented as a real. 

       Remedy:
         Reduce the value of the exponent. 


21509  0-INFO Wrong character in the numeric value 

       Cause:
         An invalid character has been identified within the value. The
         allowed characters are: the decimal digits (from 0 to 9), the
         exponential character ('E' or 'e') and the decimal digit (','). 

       Remedy:
         Insert the value using valid characters. 


21511  0-INFO Floating-point overflow 

       Cause:
         The value exceeds the maximum value which can be represented as a
         REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Use the values which fit the maximum and minimum values in the
         class of REAL data. dati REAL. 


21512  0-INFO No numeric value present 

       Cause:
         No INTEGER value has been identified. 


21513  0-INFO Reserved operand 

       Cause:
         A REAL contains a reserved IEEE operand. The value is not valid and
         cannot be used. 


21514  0-INFO Floating-point conversion domain 

       Cause:
         The conversion of a REAL value has been attempted but the input
         operand is not compatible to the format of the output operand. 


21515  0-INFO Integer underflow 

       Cause:
         The value is lower than the minimum INTEGER value. 

       Remedy:
         Use an INTEGER value greater than the minimum. 


21516  0-INFO Integer overflow 

       Cause:
         The maximum INTEGER value has been reached. 

       Remedy:
         Use an INTEGER value lower than the maximum. 


21517  0-INFO Bad integer base 

       Cause:
         The base format is not valid. 

       Remedy:
         Use a predefined base format constant.  (MLN_UNKNOWN_FMT is not
         valid in mlfm_Int2Str) 


21518  0-INFO Sign character not allowed 

       Cause:
         The value is not allowed to have a sign (either '+' or '-'). 

       Remedy:
         Remove the sign from the value. 


21519  0-INFO Floating-point underflow 

       Cause:
         The magnitude is less than the minimum value that can be
         represented as a double precision floating-point number. 

       Remedy:
         Use values that are within the maximum and minimum range for the
         REAL data type. 


21520  0-INFO Single precision loss of significance 

       Cause:
         The mantissa in input requires more bits of precision than are
         available in a single precision floating-point number. 

       Remedy:
         Use a REAL value with fewer significant digits. 


21521  0-INFO Double precision loss of significance 

       Cause:
         The mantissa in input requires more bits of precision than are
         available in a double precision floating-point number. 

       Remedy:
         Use a REAL value with fewer significant digits. 


21522  0-INFO Single precision floating-point overflow 

       Cause:
         The value is greater than the maximum value that can be represented
         as a single precision REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Use values that are within the maximum and minimum range for the
         single precision REAL data type. 


21523  0-INFO Single precision floating-point underflow 

       Cause:
         The magnitude is less than the minimum value that can be
         represented as a single precision floating-point number. 

       Remedy:
         Use a REAL value that is larger than the minimum single precision
         magnitude.

21538  0-INFO Unsigned integer overflow 

       Cause:
         The value is greater than the maximum value that can be represented
         as an unsigned integer. 

       Remedy:
         Use an unsigned integer value that is smaller than the maximum
         value of 4294967295. 


21539  0-INFO Integer format doesn't match value 

       Cause:
         The integer format specified in a call to mlfm_Str2Int does not
         match the actual value.  For example, if MLN_HEX_FMT was specified
         for the format and the string had a value of "45", this error would
         be issued since the format of a hexadecimal value begins with "0x". 

       Remedy:
         Either fix the call to mlfm_Str2Int or use MLN_UNKNOWN_FMT for the
         format argument so the function will determine the format for you. 


21540  0-INFO 


21541  0-INFO 


22528  0-INFO The command has been aborted 

       Cause:
         CTRL C (^C) key was pressed during command execution. 


22529  0-INFO Missing program name 

       Cause:
         This command requires the program name. 


22530  0-INFO Command not enabled 

       Cause:
         The maximum number of commands that can be active at the same time
         was reached. 

       Remedy:
         This command cannot be handled until an active command is
         completed. 


22531  0-INFO Copy not allowed 

       Cause:
         Remote copy is not allowed. That means, it is not possible to use
         the FILER COPY command when the source and destination files are on
         remote devices (COM0:, FD:, etc.) 

       Remedy:
         Use the remote device locally.  If it is necessary to copy files
         between two remote devices, the RAM disk should be used as a
         temporary device for the files.  For example, copy the file from
         the source device to the RAM disk (UD:) and then copy the file from
         the RAM disk to the destination device. 


22532  0-INFO * required in destination file name 

       Cause:
         If a source file specification field (file name or extension)
         contains a wildcard (*), then the same field of the destination
         file specification must be a wildcard. 


22533  0-INFO File not found 

       Cause:
         The specified file was not found on the device. 


22534  0-INFO Wildcard not allowed 

       Cause:
         Either the wildcard (*) is not allowed for this command or a
         wildcard has been used incorrectly in a combination of
         command/options/parameters. For example, the MEMORY LOAD (ML)
         command normally accepts a wildcard for the program name but, if
         the /AS option is used, the program name cannot be a wildcard. 


22535  0-INFO Too many wildcards 

       Cause:
         More than one wildcard (*) was used in a file or program
         specification. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the extra wildcard(s) from the file or program name
         specification. 


22536  0-INFO Not all files copied 

       Cause:
         One or more files were not copied. Either the file protection did
         not allow the copy or the user replied "N" to the confirm prompt. 


22537  0-INFO Not all files deleted 

       Cause:
         One or more files were not deleted. Either the file protection did
         not allow the deletion or the user replied "N" to the confirm
         prompt. 


22538  0-INFO Not all files renamed 

       Cause:
         One or more files were not renamed. Either the file protection did
         not allow the rename or the user replied "N" to the confirm prompt. 


22539  0-INFO Bad option 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a command is executed with an invalid option
         or with multiple options that conflict each other. It can also
         occur when this option, although foreseen by the command, is in
         conflict with other parameters specified with the command. 

       Remedy:
         Verify that all of the options are valid and that options and
         parameters do not conflict each other. 


22540  0-INFO Code not found 

       Cause:
         The requested command requires the program code be loaded in
         memory, but the code was not found in memory.  For example this
         error would occur when the PROGRAM TEST BREAK INSERT (PTBI) command
         is issued but the program code is not loaded. 

       Remedy:
         Check to be sure the correct program name was used in the command. 
         If the correct name was used and the code could not be found in
         memory, use the MEMORY LOAD (ML) command to load the program code. 


22541  0-INFO Bad parameter specification 

       Cause:
         An incorrect parameter specification was used. Most commonly, a
         numeric parameter was expected and an alphabetic one was used or
         vice versa. For example, the PROGRAM TEST BREAK PURGE (PTBP)
         command expects a numeric break point number parameter; using 'aaa'
         for the parameter would return this error. 

       Remedy:
         Check the manual to determine what kind of parameters are expected
         for the command. 


22542  0-INFO Device spec not allowed 

       Cause:
         The device specification is not allowed in this command.  Either
         the command works only on files present on the UD: device (RAM
         Disk) or only on program names. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the device specification from the parameter. 


22543  0-INFO Calibration program too long 

       Cause:
         The execution of the calibration program takes too much time. This
         could happen for several reasons. One could be that the calibration
         program contains loops (CYCLE, WHILE, FOR) or suspendable
         statements (READ, DELAY, WAIT,WAIT FOR,etc...). These statements
         should not be present in this program. Only simple assignment
         statements to the strictly required system variables should be
         present in the calibration file. Another reason for this error
         occurring is that the system is overloaded, too many programs or
         programs containing continuously scanned conditions. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the calibration file does not contain suspendable
         statements. If not, check if other programs that overload the
         system can either be deactivated or paused before running this
         command from the system menu or from a SYS_CALL. 


22544  0-INFO Missing file name 

       Cause:
         A file name is required for this command.  A default is not
         assumed. 

       Remedy:
         Provide the file name as a parameter. 


22545  0-INFO Missing spec of data file 


22546  0-INFO Command not executed 

       Cause:
         The command was not executed because the user replied "N" to the
         confirm prompt. 


22547  0-INFO Program not found 

       Cause:
         The requested command requires the program be loaded in memory, but
         the program was not found in memory.  For example this error would
         occur when the PROGRAM ACTIVATE (PA) command is issued but the
         program is not loaded. 

       Remedy:
         Check to be sure the correct program name was used in the command. 
         If the correct name was used and the program could not be found in
         memory, use the MEMORY LOAD (ML) command to load the program. 


22548  0-INFO Variable not found 

       Cause:
         The requested command requires a variable be loaded in memory, but
         the variable was not found in memory.  For example this error would
         occur when the MEMORY VIEW VARIABLE (MVV) command is issued but the
         variable is not loaded. 

       Remedy:
         Check to be sure the correct variable name was used in the command.
         If the correct name was used and the variable could not be found in
         memory, use the MEMORY LOAD (ML) command to load the variable. 


22549  0-INFO Device and ext not allowed 

       Cause:
         The parameter must be a program name; not a file specification.
         Program names cannot include a device name and extension. 


22550  0-INFO Bad file extension 

       Cause:
         The extension used in the file specification is not allowed for
         this command. 

       Remedy:
         Check the manual to determine the extensions which are allowed for
         this command. 


22551  0-INFO Bad variable specification 

       Cause:
         The variable specification used as a parameter is not allowed for
         this command. For example, the MEMORY ERASE VARIABLE (MEV) command
         does not allow a variable name that has leading or following
         wildcards (*). 

       Remedy:
         Use a correct variable specification as parameter to the command. 
         Correct variable names start with an alphabetic character and use
         only alphanumeric characters for the remainder of the name. 


22552  0-INFO Command not allowed in minimal configuration 

       Cause:
         The command is disallowed when the system is in the minimal
         configuration state. 

       Remedy:
         Put the system in a normal state of operation, issue a restart of
         the controller and then re-issue the command. 


22553  0-INFO Command not allowed 

       Cause:
         The command and/or the related options are disallowed in the
         current context. 

       Remedy:
         Please verify which are the allowed conditions for using the
         command. 


22554  0-INFO Calibration/turn not allowed needed SAFE recovery mode 

       Cause:
         The command and/or the related options are disallowed in the
         current context. 

       Remedy:
         Please verify which are the allowed conditions for using the
         command. 


22555  0-INFO RetentiveMemorySave not allowed needed SAFE recovery mode 

       Cause:
         The command and/or the related options are disallowed in the
         current context. 

       Remedy:
         Please verify which are the allowed conditions for using the
         command. 


22556  0-INFO RetentiveMemoryLoad not allowed needed SAFE recovery mode 

       Cause:
         The command and/or the related options are disallowed in the
         current context. 

       Remedy:
         Please verify which are the allowed conditions for using the
         command. 


22557  0-INFO Not all variables deleted 

       Cause:
         All of the variables for the specified program cannot be deleted
         (removed) from memory.  For example, if some variables are exported
         and used by another loaded program, those variables cannot be
         deleted. 

       Remedy:
         Create a situation in which it is possible to delete all of the
         variables. In the above example, erase the program using the
         exported variables from memory (using the MEMORY ERASE command)
         before trying to delete all of the variables. 


22558  0-INFO 


22559  0-INFO Code not deleted for all prog 

       Cause:
         The program code cannot be deleted (removed) from memory, as
         specified by the MEMORY ERASE (ME) command.  For example, if a
         program is active, the code cannot be deleted. 

       Remedy:
         Create a situation in which it is possible to delete the program
         code.  Typically, for deleting the code of a program, there should
         not be any active programs referencing exported routines belonging
         to the program and the program owning the code must not be active. 


22560  0-INFO 


22561  0-INFO Vars of <prog_name> not saved because protected 

       Cause:
         Some application programs disable the saving of their .VAR file for
         good functioning reasons. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message and should be ignored. 


22562  0-INFO Program has no variables 

       Cause:
         The requested command requires a variable be loaded in memory, but
         the specified program does not contain any variables. For example,
         issuing a MEMORY VIEW VARIABLE (MVV) or MEMORY ERASE VARIABLE (MEV)
         command of the program: - -  PROGRAM p -  BEGIN -    WRITE ('I am a
         program without variables', NL) -  END p 

       Remedy:
         Check that the specified program contains variables before
         attempting to issue any commands that require variables. 


22563  0-INFO File .COD not found 

       Cause:
         The requested command requires a .COD file on the UD: device (RAM
         Disk), but the file was not found. For example, this error would
         occur when the PROGRAM GO (PG) command was issued if the program
         .COD file did not exist on the UD: device. 

       Remedy:
         Use the FILER VIEW (FV) command to be sure the program .COD file
         exists before issuing the command. 


22564  0-INFO File .VAR not found 

       Cause:
         The requested command requires a .VAR file on the UD: device (RAM
         Disk), but the file was not found. 

       Remedy:
         Use the FILER VIEW (FV) command to be sure the program .VAR file
         exists before issuing the command. 


22565  0-INFO Program not loaded 

       Cause:
         The MEMORY LOAD (ML) command was issued, but the loading process
         failed.  The reason for the failure is reported on the scroll
         window of the TP or CRT (or on $SYS_CALL_OUT in case of SYS_CALL). 

       Remedy:
         Determine why the loading process failed and take the appropriate
         remedy action. 


22566  0-INFO Not all programs loaded 

       Cause:
         A MEMORY LOAD (ML) command acting on multiple programs was issued,
         but for one or more of the programs the loading process failed. 
         The reason for the failure is reported, for each program, on the
         scroll window of the TP or CRT (or on $SYS_CALL_OUT in case of
         SYS_CALL). 

       Remedy:
         Determine why the loading process failed and take the appropriate
         remedy action. 


22567  0-INFO 


22568  0-INFO File not superseded 

       Cause:
         An existing file was not superseded during a MEMORY SAVE (MS)
         operation because the user replied "N" to a confirm prompt to
         supersede. 

       Remedy:
         This message is only to inform the user and requires no remedy
         action. 


22569  0-INFO 


22570  0-INFO Not all var files saved 

       Cause:
         A MEMORY SAVE (MS) command acting on multiple programs was issued,
         but for one or more of the programs the save process failed.  The
         reason for the failure is reported, for each program, on the scroll
         window of the TP or CRT (or on $SYS_CALL_OUT in case of SYS_CALL). 

       Remedy:
         Determine why the save process failed and take the appropriate
         remedy action. 


22571  0-INFO No variables to be saved 

       Cause:
         A MEMORY SAVE (MS) command was issued, but there were no variables
         to be saved. 

       Remedy:
         Check that variables are loaded before issuing a MEMORY SAVE (MS)
         command. 


22572  0-INFO 


22573  0-INFO 


22574  0-INFO 


22575  0-INFO Not all programs deactivated 

       Cause:
         A PROGRAM DEACTIVATE (PD) command acting on multiple programs was
         issued, but for some reason one or more of the programs could not
         be deactivated. 

       Remedy:
         Determine why each program could not be deactivated and take the
         appropriate remedial action. 


22576  0-INFO Program(s) not active 

       Cause:
         A command was issued that requires an active program, such as
         PROGRAM STATE PAUSE (PSP) or PROGRAM DEACTIVATE (PD), but there
         were no active programs or the specified program was not active at
         the moment the command was issued. 

       Remedy:
         Use the PROGRAM VIEW (PV) command to obtain a list of currently
         active programs before issuing commands that require an active
         program. 


22577  0-INFO 


22578  0-INFO 


22579  0-INFO 


22580  0-INFO Not all programs paused 

       Cause:
         A PROGRAM STATE PAUSE (PSP) command acting on multiple programs was
         issued, but for some reason one or more of the programs could not
         be paused. 

       Remedy:
         Determine why each program could not be paused and take the
         appropriate remedy action. 


22581  0-INFO 


22582  0-INFO Not all programs unpaused 

       Cause:
         A PROGRAM STATE UNPAUSE (PSU) command acting on multiple programs
         was issued, but for some reason one or more of the programs could
         not be unpaused. 

       Remedy:
         Determine why each program could not be unpaused and take the
         appropriate remedial action. 


22583  0-INFO Program active 

       Cause:
         This error can be returned for a variety of reasons. For example,
         it occurs when trying to delete the code or the variables of an
         active program with the MEMORY ERASE PROGRAM /ALL /VARIABLEs
         (MEP/A/V) command.  Another example is when issuing a PROGRAM
         ACTIVATE (PA) command for a program that is already active. 

       Remedy:
         Use the PROGRAM VIEW (PV) command to see if the program is active
         before issuing commands that require the program not be active. 


22584  0-INFO Program deleted 

       Cause:
         The program used by this command was deleted from memory by another
         command that was active at the same time. 

       Remedy:
         Re-execute the command. 


22585  0-INFO Values not saved 

       Cause:
         Informational message. The modified values of variables in memory
         were not saved. 

       Remedy:
         If desired, use the MEMORY SAVE (MS) command. 


22586  0-INFO Values saved 

       Cause:
         Informational message. The save operation was completed
         successfully. 


22587  0-INFO Missing parameter specification 

       Cause:
         A required parameter was not specified in the command. For example,
         when issuing the EXECUTE (E) command, the parameter containing the
         statement to be executed must always be specified. 

       Remedy:
         Re-issue the command specifying all of the required parameters. 


22588  0-INFO No mapped port 

       Cause:
         No ports of the specified category are configured. 

       Remedy:
         Check the wiring between the logical port and physical I/O point.
         Use the I/O configuration tool. 


22589  0-INFO Line not found 

       Cause:
         The requested command is to be performed at a specified line of a
         program, but that line cannot be found.  For example, this error
         would occur when issuing a PROGRAM TEST BREAK INSERT (PTBI) command
         for a line that did not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Determine the correct line number before issuing the command. 


22590  0-INFO Bad break specification 

       Cause:
         The command requires a breakpoint number parameter, but the value
         is specified incorrectly.  The breakpoint number parameter must be
         a positive number less than 250 (maximum number of breakpoints
         allowed) consisting of all decimal digits. For example
         SYS_CALL('PTBP', '-2', 'pippo') would cause this error. 

       Remedy:
         Check the correctness of the breakpoint specification in the
         command. 


22591  0-INFO Label not found 

       Cause:
         The command requires a label, but the specified label does not
         exist. For example, this error would occur when issuing a PROGRAM
         TEST BREAK INSERT /LABEL (PTBI/L) command at a label not present in
         the code of the specified program. 

       Remedy:
         Be sure the label exists before performing any operations on it. 


22592  0-INFO Routine not found 

       Cause:
         The command requires a routine, but the specified routine does not
         exist. For example, the error would occur when issuing a PROGRAM
         TEST BREAK INSERT /ROUTINE (PTBI/R) command at a routine not
         present in the code of the specified program. 

       Remedy:
         Be sure the routine exists before performing any operations on it. 


22593  0-INFO 


22594  0-INFO Break not found 

       Cause:
         The command requires a breakpoint, but the specified breakpoint
         does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Use the PROGRAM TEST BREAK VIEW (PTBV) command to be sure the
         breakpoint exists before performing any operations on it. 


22595  0-INFO Cannot set break at this line 

       Cause:
         An incorrect program line was specified for the PROGRAM TEST BREAK
         INSERT (PTBI) command. 

       Remedy:
         Use the PROGRAM EDIT (PE) or FILER PRINT /LIST (FP/L) command to
         find the correct line number. Be sure that the line where the
         breakpoint is meant to be inserted allows breakpoints (e.g., does
         not belong to the program header, is not a BEGIN statement, does
         belong to the executable section, etc.). 


22596  0-INFO Step mode and program mismatch 

       Cause:
         The specified step mode is incorrect for the specified program. 
         For example, this error would occur when issuing a PROGRAM TEST
         STEP CYCLE (PTSC) in a program that does not contain a CYCLE
         (statement or BEGIN attribute) or a PROGRAM TEST STEP MOVE (PTSM)
         in a non-holdable program. 

       Remedy:
         Check for compatibility between the program and the step mode. 


22597  0-INFO Step mode not set 

       Cause:
         A PROGRAM TEST STEP VIEW (PTSV) command was issued, but no step
         mode was set. 

       Remedy:
         This message is only to inform the user and requires no remedy
         action. 


22598  0-INFO Break already set at this line 

       Cause:
         A PROGRAM TEST BREAK INSERT (PTBI) command was issued, but a
         breakpoint was already set at the specified line. 

       Remedy:
         This message is only to inform the user and requires no remedy
         action. 


22599  0-INFO Too many break set 

       Cause:
         A PROGRAM TEST BREAK INSERT (PTBI) command was issued, but the
         total number of breakpoints set exceeds the maximum limit.  The
         specified breakpoint is not set. 

       Remedy:
         Delete some breakpoints in the system. Note that the limit is as
         system-wide and not per-program. The current maximum is 250. 


22600  0-INFO Program counter at this line 

       Cause:
         A PROGRAM TEST BREAK PURGE (PTBP) command was issued for a
         breakpoint, but the execution of the program owning the breakpoint
         is currently at the statement containing the breakpoint. In this
         situation the breakpoint cannot be deleted. 

       Remedy:
         Re-issue the command if the program execution continued since the
         command was first issued, or take some action to move the program
         counter from the line where the breakpoint is set. For example, if
         the program is paused, issue an unpause; enter MEMORY DEBUG and
         issue the SET_EXEC command. 


22601  0-INFO Parameter must be a number 

       Cause:
         Something other than a number was specified for a command requiring
         a numeric parameter. 


22602  0-INFO Bad arm number 

       Cause:
         The specified arm number was incorrect or not present in the
         current configuration. 


22603  0-INFO Bad ax number 

       Cause:
         The specified axis number was incorrect or not present in the
         current arm configuration. 


22604  0-INFO String too long 

       Cause:
         The specified string parameter is longer than the maximum allowed. 


22605  0-INFO 


22606  0-INFO 


22607  0-INFO Bad time format 

       Cause:
         An incorrect time was specified. 

       Remedy:
         The time must be specified using the format HH:MM:SS, where HH
         means Hours (00-24), MM means Minutes (00-59), and SS means Seconds
         (00-59). 


22608  0-INFO Bad date format 

       Cause:
         An incorrect date was specified. 

       Remedy:
         The date must be specified using the format YY-MM-DD, where DD
         means Day (01-31), MM means Month (01-12), and YY means Year
         (00-99). 


22609  0-INFO Bad year format 

       Cause:
         An incorrect year was specified.  The year must be specified using
         a two character format. For example, 1991 must be expressed as 91. 


22610  0-INFO 


22611  0-INFO 


22612  0-INFO 


22613  0-INFO Disabled due to cmnd conflict 

       Cause:
         The command cannot be executed because it is in mutual exclusion
         with another currently active command. If an edit environment is
         being entered (IDE, ProgramEdit or MemoryDebug), please check that
         no other programming environments are open. Please note that this
         error can occur also in case the IDE page is open but no program is
         viewed. 

       Remedy:
         Wait until the command in mutual exclusion is completed. 


22614  0-INFO 


22615  0-INFO Operation not completed 

       Cause:
         The operation did not complete successfully and the user replied
         negative to the confirmation. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


22616  0-INFO 


22617  0-INFO Cannot rename on different device 

       Cause:
         The RENAME operation is allowed only on the same device. 


22618  0-INFO Kind of print not allowed 

       Cause:
         The PRINT command is not allowed between the source and destination
         devices specified. 


22619  0-INFO Cannot open output stream 

       Cause:
         The operation is not executed either because the device was not
         found or the limit of possible files opened was already reached. 

       Remedy:
         Check the device connection, the serial line cable, and the port
         characteristics. Close an opened file. 


22620  0-INFO Bad port name 

       Cause:
         The device specified is not a correct port name.  Check the use of
         the ':' at the end of the device name. 


22621  0-INFO Port type not allowed 

       Cause:
         The specified port is not correct for the required operation. 

       Remedy:
         Check the port name.  Correct ports are $DIN, $DOUT, $AIN, $AOUT,
         $GI, $GO, $SDI, $SDO. 


22622  0-INFO Ambiguous or bad value 

       Cause:
         The index or the forced value of the port is not correct. 

       Remedy:
         Be sure the index value is within the valid range for the current
         I/O configuration and a forced value is valid for the specified
         kind of port. 


22623  0-INFO No memory for this operation 

       Cause:
         There is not enough memory for executing the command. 

       Remedy:
         Remove unused programs and variables from execution memory (use the
         MEMORY ERASE group of commands). If not sufficient, check the
         system configuration of memory resources. 


22624  0-INFO 


22625  0-INFO 


22626  0-INFO

22631  0-INFO 


22632  0-INFO 


22633  0-INFO Bad window name 

       Cause:
         The specified string does not correspond to a window name. 


22634  0-INFO Bad board index 

       Cause:
         The specified index board is not present in the system. 


22635  0-INFO Holdable stmt only in PROG 

       Cause:
         The EXECUTE (E) command was issued with holdable statements (LOCK,
         UNLOCK, RESUME, MOVE, CANCEL, etc..), but the state of the system
         was not PROG. 

       Remedy:
         Change the OP/TP switches to PROG. 


22636  0-INFO Bad stmt for immediate mode 

       Cause:
         The statement specified as parameter in the EXECUTE (E) command is
         not allowed. For example, DISABLE/ENABLE/PURGE CONDITION would
         cause this error. 


22637  0-INFO Immediate execution not allowed 

       Cause:
         Execution of the EXECUTE (E) command is not compatible with the
         state of the system. For example, this error would occur when the
         state of the system is changed from PROG to AUTO when the EXECUTE
         of a holdable statement is currently active. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the state of the system is not changed when executing a
         holdable statement. 


22638  0-INFO 


22639  0-INFO Bad numerical value 

       Cause:
         A numeric parameter includes a non-numeric character (e.g., 12c3). 

       Remedy:
         Check the input parameter 


22640  0-INFO Bad $GEN_OVR value 

       Cause:
         The value specified is not in the allowed range (1-100). 


22641  0-INFO Bad $TP_GEN_INCR value 

       Cause:
         The value specified is not in the allowed range (1-10). 


22642  0-INFO Varfile name conflict 

       Cause:
         The PROGRAM GO (PG) command was issued for a program already loaded
         in memory, with the variable values loaded from a variable file
         with a different name than the program. 

       Remedy:
         Use the PROGRAM ACTIVATE (PA) command to start the current
         situation, or use the MEMORY ERASE VARIABLE (MEV) command and then
         PROGRAM GO (PG) to start the new configuration (with the variable
         file name the same as the program name). 


22643  0-INFO File extension required 

       Cause:
         This command requires the extension of the file specification. A
         default is not assumed. 


22644  0-INFO Bad device operation 

       Cause:
         The specified device cannot be used for this kind of operation. 


22645  0-INFO Source file must be binary 

       Cause:
         Only binary files (for example .COD, .BKC, .VAR, or .BKV,...)can be
         used as source file in a print (FP) operation from UD: to UD:. 


22646  0-INFO Destination file cannot be binary 

       Cause:
         A binary file ( e.g. .COD, .BKC, .VAR, or .BKV, ...) cannot be used
         as destination in a print (FP) operation from UD: to UD:. 


22647  0-INFO 


22648  0-INFO Program not activated 

       Cause:
         The PROGRAM ACTIVATE (PA) command was issued, but the program
         cannot be activated. The reason for the failure is reported on the
         scroll window of the TP or CRT (or on $SYS_CALL_OUT in case of
         SYS_CALL). 


22649  0-INFO Missing variable name 

       Cause:
         The command requires a variable name parameter, but the variable
         name was not specified. For example, the MEMORY ERASE VARIABLE
         (MEV) command requires a variable name parameter. 

       Remedy:
         Re-issue the command specifying the variable name. In most cases,
         the wildcard (*) is allowed. 


22650  0-INFO Command not done for all programs 

       Cause:
         A command acting on multiple programs was issued, but the operation
         failed for some of the programs. The reason for the failure is
         reported on the scroll window of the TP or CRT (or on $SYS_CALL_OUT
         in case of SYS_CALL). 

       Remedy:
         Determine the reason for the failure and take the appropriate
         remedy action. 


22651  0-INFO No application event defined 

       Cause:
         The UTILITY APPLICATION (UA) command was issued, but there was no
         application event (AC_CALL_CRT, AC_CALL_TP) enabled at the time. 
         Refer to the "Condition Handlers" chapter of the PDL2 Language
         Manual for more detailed information. 

       Remedy:
         Before issuing the command, create and activate a program that
         defines and enables conditions, for example: - -  CONDITION[1]: -  
         WHEN EVENT AC_CALL_CRT DO -    . . . -  ENDCONDITION -    . . . - 
         ENABLE CONDITION[1] 


22652  0-INFO Invalid password 

       Cause:
         The password specified for the CONFIGURE CNTRLER PASSWORD (CCP)
         command is not valid. 


22653  0-INFO Not enough access rights 

       Cause:
         The user that is logged in the controller does not have enough
         access rights for executing this command. 

       Remedy:
         Please login again (SET LOGIN coomand) with a username and a
         password related to a user profile previously defined (CONFIGURE
         CONTOLLER LOGIN ADD) that allows the operation to be accomplished. 


22654  0-INFO Disabled due to DRIVE ON state 

       Cause:
         This command can be executed only when in the DRIVE OFF state. 


22655  0-INFO Disabled due to DRIVE OFF state 

       Cause:
         This command can be executed only when in the DRIVE ON state. 


22656  0-INFO Disabled due to HOLD system state 

       Cause:

         program, but the operation failed for some program. 

       Remedy:
         Determine the cause of the failure and take the appropriate remedy
         action. 


22660  0-INFO Not supported option 


22661  0-INFO Cannot increase $GEN_OVR 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to increase the value of $GEN_OVR from a program
         (SYS_CALL) or from a remote process for security reasons. In these
         cases $GEN_OVR can only be decreased in value. 

       Remedy:
         If the $GEN_OVR value needs to be incremented, the user can press
         the TP appropriate keys or can issue the command SET ARM GEN_OVR
         (SAG) from the keyboard (if the Teach Pendant is disconnected) or
         from the Teach Pendant command menus. 


22662  0-INFO Too many options 

       Cause:
         Too many options were specified in the command. For example,
         issuing a PROGRAM ACTIVATE /CYCLE /MOVE command (PA/C/M) would
         return this error. 

       Remedy:
         Re-issue the command specifying the correct number of options. 


22663  0-INFO /List requires /Back and .COD 

       Cause:
         Returned when issuing a FILER TRANSLATE /LIST (FT/L) without also
         specifying the /BACK option.  The listing can be obtained only when
         translating from a .COD to a .PDL file, so the FILER TRANSLATE (FT)
         should be executed with the /BACK option. Otherwise, the effect
         would be to translate from a .PDL to a .COD and the listing could
         not be created. The listing is not allowed on a .VAR or .LSV file. 

       Remedy:
         Re-issue the command with the correct options. 


22664  0-INFO Not all files translated 

       Cause:
         The FILER TRANSLATE (FT) command was issued for more than one
         program but the operation failed for some programs. The reason for
         the failure is reported on the scroll window of the TP or CRT (or
         on $SYS_CALL_OUT in case of SYS_CALL). 

       Remedy:
         Determine the reason for the failure and take the appropriate
         remedy action. 


22665  0-INFO Arm number required 


22666  0-INFO Disabled due to TP out of cabinet 

       Cause:
         This command cannot be executed when the teach pendant (TP) is
         connected and out of cabinet. This limitation is linked to safety
         reasons. 

       Remedy:
         Insert the teach pnedant in the controller cabinet before issuing
         the command again. 


22667  0-INFO Not enough space for pop-up window 

       Cause:
         The pop-up window cannot appear on the screen because there is not
         enough space. 

       Remedy:
         Remove some other pop-up windows before re-issuing the command. 


22668  0-INFO Disabled due to remote state 

       Cause:
         This command cannot be executed because the controller is in a
         remote state. 

       Remedy:
         Change the controller status to execute the command. 


22669  0-INFO Bad baud rate value 

       Cause:
         The specified baud rate value is not in the range of allowed
         values. 

       Remedy:
         Use one of the allowed values (110, 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600,
         19200, 38400). 


22670  0-INFO Field not present in this path 

       Cause:
         The specified field has not been declared as belonging to the path
         node. 

       Remedy:
         If the field is needed, add it to the NODEDEF declaration for the
         path. 


22671  0-INFO Not a path type variable 

       Cause:

       Remedy:
         Check for the correctness of the operations. 


22672  0-INFO Bad arm number for this path 

       Cause:
         This error happens when trying to insert a node or modifying the
         $MAIN_POS for a node belonging to a path variable using a different
         arm than the one declared in the node structure. 

       Remedy:
         Use the arm declared in the node structure for that path variable. 


22673  0-INFO Cannot insert. Check state selector 

       Cause:
         The REC or the MOD key has been pressed on the TP. The action
         cannot be executed because the system state is not in the right
         condition. Teaching is only permitted in PROG state. 

       Remedy:
         Put the controller in PROG state. Check the current state on the
         system screen in the upper window (system window.) 


22674  0-INFO Cannot delete. Check state selector 

       Cause:
         The DEL key has been pressed on the TP. The action cannot be
         executed because the system state is not in the right condition.
         Deletion is only permitted in PROG state. 

       Remedy:
         Put the controller in PROG state. Check the current state on the
         system screen in the upper window (system window.) 


22675  0-INFO Cannot modify. Bad var type 

       Cause:
         The MOD key has been pressed on the TP. The action cannot be
         executed because the current variable data type is not allowed in
         this operation. You can only modify single data type variable at a
         time (not arrays or path variable type). 


22676  0-INFO Wrong node index 

       Cause:
         You are trying to modify a field of a path node with a bad node
         index value. 

       Remedy:
         Check the node index value and the current number of nodes for that
         path. 


22677  0-INFO Cannot modify. Check state selector

24576  2-WARNING Program <prog_id> started 

       Cause:
         Indicates the startup program, specified in $STARTUP, was started. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message and requires no user remedy. 


24577  2-WARNING Program <program_name> not started <error_num> 

       Cause:
         Indicates the startup program was not activated. The error number
         reported in this message is the cause of the failure of the
         activation. 

       Remedy:
         Check the error corresponding to the number reported with this
         message. For example: "STARTUP program not started 22563" indicates
         error number 22563 which is "File .cod not found". 


24578  2-WARNING STARTUP program <prog_id>. Press START 

       Cause:
         Indicates the startup program was activated. Being a holdable
         program, it also requires the START button be pressed. 


24579  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL bad char in cmnd 

       Cause:
         Indicates a non alphanumeric character is specified in the command
         string of the SYS_CALL. The command string of the SYS_CALL is the
         first parameter to provide to the SYS_CALL. The following example
         would cause this error since the "_" is non alphabetic: - - 
         SYS_CALL ('_i', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         The command string of the SYS_CALL can only contain alphanumeric
         characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9). Check which is the correct string
         corresponding to the desired command. 


24580  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL bad cmnd 

       Cause:
         Indicates a nonexisting command is specified in the command string
         (first parameter) of the SYS_CALL. The following example would
         cause this error since the MEMORY VIEW (MV) menu does not include a
         K command. - -  SYS_CALL('mvk', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         Check which is the correct string corresponding to the desired
         command. 


24581  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL too few char in cmnd 

       Cause:
         Indicates the command string (first parameter) in the SYS_CALL
         contains too few characters for the command identification. The
         following example would cause this error since FILER (F) is not a
         complete command: - -  SYS_CALL('f', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the first parameter to the SYS_CALL. 


24582  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL too many char in cmnd 

       Cause:
         Indicates the command string (first parameter) in the SYS_CALL
         contains too many characters for the command identification. The
         following example would cause this error since the FILER COPY (FC)
         command does not have any submenus: - -  SYS_CALL('fcgh', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the first parameter to the SYS_CALL. 


24583  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL cmnd not available 

       Cause:
         Indicates a command already present on the command menu but not yet
         implemented is specified in the command string of the SYS_CALL. 

       Remedy:
         Do not use unimplemented commands as parameters to SYS_CALL. 


24584  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL command not allowed 

       Cause:
         Indicates a command that cannot be executed from SYS_CALL is
         specified in the command string of SYS_CALL. The following example
         would cause this error since PROGRAM EDIT (PE) is not permitted
         from SYS_CALL: - -  SYS_CALL('PE', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         Check which are the commands not allowed from SYS_CALL and do not
         use them. 


24585  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL bad number of parameters 

       Cause:
         Indicates the number of parameters given to the SYS_CALL is not
         what is expected for that command. The following example would
         cause this error as the name of the label on which the breakpoint
         should be set is not specified: - -  SYS_CALL('ptbi/l', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         Check which is the correct number of parameters needed for a
         certain command and specify them as parameters of the SYS_CALL. 


24586  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL bad option specified 

       Cause:
         Indicates an unexpected option for a certain command is specified
         in the SYS_CALL. The following example would cause this error as K
         is not a valid option for the PROGRAM VIEW (PV) command. - - 
         SYS_CALL('PV/K', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         Check which are the expected options for the desired command. An
         easy way for checking this is to issue the option key (/) for the
         command on the CRT/TP.  When issued, a menu of possible options for
         the command is displayed. 


24587  4-PAUSE SYS_CALL no options allowed 

       Cause:
         Indicates an option is specified in the command string when the
         command does not expect any. The following example would cause this
         error as the PROGRAM TEST STEP CYCLE (PTSC) command does not have
         any options: - -  SYS_CALL('PTSC/F', 'pippo') 

       Remedy:
         Remove the option specification from the command string: in the
         example above the correct statement is: - -  SYS_CALL('PTSC',
         'pippo'). 


24588  4-PAUSE No Command session available 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to open a Command request but non is available. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that all outstanding command sessions have been closed. 


24589  4-PAUSE Request already active 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to issue a command on a session that already
         has a command oustanding. 

       Remedy:
         Wait until the existing command completes. 


24590  4-PAUSE Missing technology value 

       Cause:
         The CCLA/T has been issued but with no technology value. 

       Remedy:
         Call with a user technology value. 


24591  2-WARNING Executing of <program_name> failed <error_num> 

       Cause:
         EPL_GEN program did not start  or returned an error. 


24592  4-PAUSE Missing the output filename 

       Cause:
         The /Output option has been specified but no file could be found. 

       Remedy:
         The last parameter when using /Output must be the filename for the
         output. 


24593  0-INFO

25087  0-INFO SYSTEM ERROR: Unknown DPM:%x 


25600  2-WARNING Bad $TUNE[1], set <value> cond scan 

       Cause:
         A value out of range is assigned to the variable $TUNE[1]
         containing the Condition Handler scanning time. The correct range
         is from 10 to 5000 milliseconds. For example, "$TUNE[1] := 6000"
         would cause this warning to be displayed. 

       Remedy:
         No remedy is needed as the system automatically changes the value
         of $TUNE[1] to the default value (20 milliseconds). 


25601  2-WARNING <prog_id> cond <cond_num> has been redefined 

       Cause:
         A condition is defined more than once. The following example shows
         a situation in which this warning would be returned: - -  PROGRAM a
         -  BEGIN -    CONDITION[1]: -      WHEN HOLD DO -        $FDOUT[5]
         := ON -    ENDCONDITION -    . . . -    . . . -    -- Execution of
         the next statement will -    --   cause the error if the
         condition[1] was -    --   not previously purged. -   
         CONDITION[1]: -      WHEN START DO -        $FDOUT[5] := OFF -   
         ENDCONDITION -    . . . -  END a - In the above example,
         CONDITION[1] is defined twice. The warning is given when the second
         definition is executed. Note that only the last definition is
         considered, so in the example above the event monitored will be the
         START and not the HOLD. 

       Remedy:
         No action is necessary. This is only a warning. It is up to the
         user to decide if a certain condition is to be redefined at a
         certain point of the program or if this warning indicates a
         programming error. 


25602  2-WARNING <prog_id> cond <cond_num> already enabled 

       Cause:
         An enabling operation is performed on a condition and the condition
         is already enabled. The following example could cause such a
         warning when the condition triggers: - -  CONDITION[3] NODISABLE: -
         WHEN HOLD DO -      ENABLE CONDITION[3] -  ENDCONDITION - In fact,
         the NODISABLE clause allows the condition to remain enabled when it
         triggers; so the ENABLE action has no meaning in this context and
         would cause the warning to be returned. Another case is when the
         condition contains motion events and the condition is enabled both
         globally and locally. In this case the condition may trigger at the
         wrong motion segment. In particular, this can happen when the
         global condition is also locally enabled for a MOVEFLY .. ADVANCE
         and the condition expression is AT END. It is recommended that the
         same condition or type of condition event should not be used
         globally and locally at the same time. 

       Remedy:
         No action is necessary, this is only a warning. The user should
         decide if the situation is correct or if this warning indicates a
         programming error. 


25603  2-WARNING <prog_id> cond <cond_num> already disabled 

       Cause:
         A disabling operation is performed on a condition and the condition
         is in fact already disabled. 

       Remedy:
         No action is necessary, this is only a warning. It is up to the
         user to decide if the situation is correct or if this warning
         indicates a programming error. 


25604  8-HOLD Cond <cond_num> not found 

       Cause:
         A condition that does not exist is referenced in a statement.  The
         following example will cause this error since the condition was
         purged (deleted) right before it is used in the ENABLE statement: -
         -  . . . -  BEGIN -    . . . -    PURGE CONDITION[1] -    ENABLE
         CONDITION[1] 

       Remedy:
         Check the reason why the condition is not present (e.g., not
         defined, purged, etc.). 


25605  4-PAUSE Cond used locally 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to purge a condition while the condition was
         locally used. For example, if CONDITION[2] in the following program
         segment triggers during the MOVE, this error could occur since
         CONDITION[1] is locally enabled on the MOVE and the action of
         CONDITION[2] is to purge it: - -  VAR p1 : POSITION -  . . . - 
         BEGIN -    . . . -    CONDITION [1]: -      . . . -    ENDCONDITION
         -    CONDITION [2]: -      WHEN $DIN[1]+ DO -        PURGE
         CONDITION[1] -    ENDCONDITION -    ENABLE CONDITION[2] -    --
         CONDITION[1] is locally enabled in -    --   the following
         statement -    MOVE TO p1 WITH CONDITION[1] 

       Remedy:
         Check the PURGE CONDITION statement use. This statement should be
         executed when the condition being purged is not locally enabled. 


25606  8-HOLD No memory resources for cond 

       Cause:
         The operations to be performed for handling conditions requires the
         use of memory. This error indicates there is not sufficient memory. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or remove something from
         memory. 


25607  12-DRIVE OFF No CPU resources for cond 

       Cause:
         This error can occur when bad condition handler programming methods
         are used. Usually this happens when the actions of one condition
         handler trigger the execution of another condition handler or when
         a condition is continuously enabled, by either an ENABLE CONDITION
         statement or the NODISABLE attribute. The actions that can cause
         this problem are: the program actions (ACTIVATE, PAUSE, etc..), the
         routine call action, the RESUME action, and the SIGNAL and CANCEL
         of semaphore actions. These actions use a lot of CPU time, and
         therefore should be used in conditions that do not trigger every
         scan. 

       Remedy:
         Check if there are programs running with condition handlers written
         as described above.  Change those conditions to use less CPU time. 
         For example, if possible make the state condition an event
         condition, or remove the NODISABLE attribute and enable the
         condition only when it is strictly needed. If, on the contrary,
         there are programming mistakes contact COMAU
         (service.robotics@comau.com).

       Cause:
         There are one or more I/O points (ports) in conditions that are not
         present. 

       Remedy:
         Check to see if there are some programs running with conditions and
         if the ports affected by the conditions are present.  Probably due
         to an I/O configuration, these ports are no longer mapped or are
         mapped with a different index.  The failure number can help
         you--search for this number in the standard error. 


26634  14-FATAL Failure <error_num> in $TIMER allocation 

       Cause:
         There is not enough system memory to allocate all required timers,
         probably due to a large value for $NUM_TIMERS. 

       Remedy:
         Reduce the $NUM_TIMERS value to the minimum required in your
         application.

26646  2-WARNING Event $<port_name>[<port_num>]<transition> triggers too

       Cause:
         The value of a port changes too frequently. Due to system overload
         it is not guaranteed that all the flips are detected. This occurs
         for example if a $DIN passes from 1 to 0 and to 1 again in a time
         interval of 30 milliseconds. 

       Remedy:
         Change the I/O event on that port in a I/O state condition.

       Cause:
         The PROGR/AUTO switch on the control panel does not work correctly.
         There is more than one signal at the same time.  This means that
         the switch position is ambiguous. 

       Remedy:
         Check the PROGR/AUTO switch or connection with the control panel
         electronic board. 


28715  2-WARNING $TUNE[<index>] value out of range 

       Cause:

         Release the HOLD by pressing the HOLD button on control panel or
         the teach pendant. 


28718  2-WARNING Release the Enabling Device on TP 

       Cause:
         This message is issued when the system enters the DRIVE-OFF
         condition and the enabling device is pressed. 

       Remedy:
         Release the enabling device before issuing the DRIVE-ON again. 


28719  2-WARNING TP presence switch on 

       Cause:
         The TP Enabling Device switch was pressed while the TP is on the
         cabinet. This is also a safety test for revealed TP presence switch
         malfunction. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the TP from the cabinet if you want to use a MANUAL MOTION
         feature that requires the Enabling Device switch or check if the TP
         presence switch is working correctly. 


28720  2-WARNING DRIVE ON not allowed in ALARM state 

       Cause:
         The system received a DRIVE ON request in ALARM state.

       Remedy:
         In AUTO-R issue the DRIVE ON signal from the remote device. 


28725  2-WARNING START not allowed in ALARM state 

       Cause:
         The system received a START request in ALARM state. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the ALARM before issuing the START request. 


28726  2-WARNING START not allowed in HOLD state 

       Cause:
         The system received a starting request (START) during the HOLD
         state. This HOLD condition could be forced in case the user did not
         execute yet the requested operation that is viewed on the status
         window. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the HOLD condition before issuing the START command. 


28727  2-WARNING START allowed from TP only 

       Cause:
         The system received a remote START request but the state selector
         is positioned on PROG-T1, PROG-T2 or AUTO-L.

       Remedy:
         The AUX_SET built-in is only allowed on specific configurations of
         robots having auxiliary axes. Check if the configuration is correct
         or, if needed, ask for a new configuration file. 


28800  2-WARNING AUX_SET built-in in progress 

       Cause:
         You are requesting a command that is not allowed during the
         execution of the AUX_SET PDL2 built-in. Possible commands that are
         not allowed contemporarely to the AUX_SET built-in are: DRIVE ON or
         another AUX_SET or AUX_DRIVES built-in. 

       Remedy:
         Wait for the completion of the first command before issuing again
         the refused one. If needed, try to syncronize those processes that
         could cause the contemporaneus issuing of commands. 


28801  2-WARNING AUX_SET not allowed during other commands 

       Cause:
         An AUX_SET built-in has been issued from a PDL2 program meanwhile
         another incompatible command on motors was in progress. The AUX_SET
         built-in cannot be executed while one of the following procedures
         is in progress: DRIVE ON and DRIVE OFF commands, activation and
         deactivation of "energy saving" state, power failure recovery. 

       Remedy:
         Issue again the AUX_SET built-in when no other incompatible command
         is in progress. Try to synchronize the program that executes the
         AUX_SET built-in with processes that issue the other commands. 


28802  10-DRIVE OFF AUX_SET: procedure <procedure name> failed

28936  11-DRIVE OFF Emergency stop for disconnected WiTP 

       Cause:
         Input 41($SDI[41]) and 42 ($SDI[42]) on safety boards are low,
         indicating that the stop contactors of the emergency stop button
         are open due to the disconnection of the teach pendant. The WiTP is
         still paired to the robot controller but does not communicate.
         Under these conditions, it is not possible to switch motors on
         until the connection is not restored or the teach pendant is not
         unpaired. 

       Remedy:
         Please check that the WiTP is switched on in order to restore the
         Wi-Fi communication, checking the absence of obstacoles. In case

       Cause:
         Inputs 49 ($SDI[49]) and 50 ($SDI[50]) on the safety board are low.
         This means that contacts of the stop button in the wireless teach
         pendant have been opened. 

       Remedy:
         Close the contacts of the stop button, restoring the button itself. 


28942  2-WARNING Check that MGD is unmounted from the robot 

       Cause:
         The MGD could be mounted on the robot: before entering
         Local/Remote/T2 states, you have to confirm that the MGD has been
         unmounted. 

       Remedy:
         Unlatch this alarm ONLY after having unmounted the MGD from the
         robot in order to avoid the projection of the device while the
         robot is operating in automatic modes. 


28943  11-DRIVE OFF SDM diagnostic - $SDI[<port_index>] (sts : 0x<status>) 

       Cause:
         The SDM board detected an error during self-diagnosis. The status
         (sts) information encodes the $SDI[89..96] bits. Least significant
         bit corresponds to $SDI[89], while the most significant bit
         corresponds to $SDI[96]. 

       Remedy:
         Switch OFF and ON the controller, in order to repeat SDM board
         self-diagnosis. If $SDI[89] bit is zero, please check if the error
         disappears ($SDI[89] bit returns to 1) disconnecting cables on
         X108/SDM, X109/SDM connectors. If error is cleared disconnecting
         cable at X108, the issue is caused by main enable circuit. If error
         is cleared disconnecting cable at X109, the issue is caused by the
         auxiliary enable circuit. If one of $SDI[91] or $SDI[92] bits is
         zero, please check if the error disappears disconnecting the flat
         cable attached to X10/SDM. If error clears, the issue may be caused
         by the flat cable at X10 or by ERM1 board. In case all above
         troubleshooting fail, replace SDM board. 


28944  10-DRIVE OFF SDM configuration  TP Wired/Wireless not OK - $SDI[82] 

       Cause:

       Remedy:
         Please check the cables on X302 and X110 connectors. Ignore this
         indication if contemporarely present with the SDM diagnostic error
         - $SDI[10]. 


28945  10-DRIVE OFF SDM mismatching stop time selectors - $SDI[83] 

       Cause:
         The selected value with the SW1 and Sw2 rotary switches is not the
         same. 

       Remedy:
         Please input the same value. 


28946  8-HOLD SDM anomaly in the power supply state V24SAFE - $SDI[84] 

       Cause:
         Voltage on the 24V SAFE module has been detected when it is not
         provided anymore by the SDM. 

       Remedy:
         If the problem only occurs upon the DRIVE OFF command, please check
         that the loads linked to the 24V SAFE supply do not exceed in
         parallel capacity. In case, isolate the loads with a diode in
         series. If the problem occurs upon DRIVE ON command, please check
         that no tensions are present on the connections due to couplings of
         motor cables powered by the command. 


28947  10-DRIVE OFF SDM Enable 1 output in short circuit - $SDI[85] 

       Cause:
         The self-diagnosis of the Enable 1 output detected a failure or an
         error in the connection which disallows the switching off of the
         controller (voltage lower than 2,5V in the off state). 

       Remedy:
         Please check the cables of the auxiliary axes eventually present,
         disconnect X108 and X109 connectors and issue a switching off/on of
         the system in order to verify if the voltage comes from the extern
         of the SDM module or if there is a damage in the output circuits of
         the module. 


28948  11-DRIVE OFF The system state manager is receiving too many events 

       Cause:
         It is possible that some PDL2 builtins/statements requiring an
         update of the state of the system like ERR_POST, CANCEL ALARM etc
         are executed very quickly. 

       Remedy:
         If the problem is identified into a PDL2 program, it is necessary
         to verify the logic of the program and optimize the requests to the
         system. 


28949  10-DRIVE OFF SDM error on input state selector - $SDI[97] 

       Cause:
         The self-diagnosis of the inputs related to the state selector
         detected a connection error.

         suppliers dedicated to the multibus cable and to applications. 

       Remedy:
         Please check if the error occurs during the DRIVE ON phase; in this
         case the overload/short circuit is on the 24V SAFE BRANCH. If the
         error also occurs in DRIVE OFF, the overload/shortcircuit is on the
         24V I/O branch. Please disconnect the cables linked to X124, X126,
         X128 and X106 connectors one by one in order to verify if the error
         is cleared upon alarm RESET key.

         RoboSAFE robot parameters or the RoboSAFE software version is older
         than C5G software release. Check for exchanged component (C.F
         and/or SafeKey) between already initialized C5G controls, or for
         software reloading procedure not completed properly. 

       Remedy:
         Perform software reloading procedure (system and TP, fully reload)
         and RoboSAFE initialization procedure. If the problem persists,
         also after the software reloading, contact Comau service.

29695  0-INFO SYSTEM ERROR: 


29696  0-INFO Not enough window space 

       Cause:
         There are too many display command windows active on screen. 

       Remedy:
         Close one or more windows that you do not need at the same time. 


29697  0-INFO Too many parameter 

       Cause:
         More parameters were specified than required in display command. 

       Remedy:
         Check the command and remove extra parameter(s). 


29698  0-INFO Bad start of range 

       Cause:
         The start of range value (eg: 1..5) is not a valid value. 

       Remedy:
         Check if the start value is bigger than the stop value or an
         out-of-range number. 


29699  0-INFO Bad end of range 

       Cause:
         The stop of range value (eg: 1..5) is an invalid value. 

       Remedy:
         Check if the stop value is smaller than the start value or an
         out-of-range number. 


29700  0-INFO Range too large 

       Cause:
         The range specified is too large to fit into the display window. 

       Remedy:
         Split the range into more groups and specify one at a time. 


29701  0-INFO Invalid parameter 

       Cause:
         An invalid parameter was specified in a display command. 

       Remedy:
         Check the manual to determine the proper parameter specification
         for that command. 


29702  0-INFO CURSOR DOWN:select;ENTER:close;PREV:end 

       Cause:
         This is an help message to describe how to move on windows open in
         the Display command. The down arrow key moves the focus on the
         different open windows; the ENTER key closes the window; the PREV
         key exists from windows selection. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


29703  0-INFO Program already displayed 

       Cause:
         The program is already displayed in a display window. 

       Remedy:
         Check the current display windows for the program. 


29704  0-INFO Bad arm number 

       Cause:
         Invalid arm number specification in a DISPLAY command requiring an
         arm number. 

       Remedy:
         Check to see if the arm exists. 


29705  0-INFO 


29706  0-INFO No display active 

       Cause:
         The DISPLAY CLOSE SELECT (DCS) command was issued without any
         active display windows on the screen or all active displays have
         just been closed. 

       Remedy:
         There is not a problem, the command automatically terminates
         because there are no active display windows. 


29707  0-INFO 


29708  0-INFO 


29709  0-INFO Bad sysvar display period 

       Cause:
         The predefined variable $TUNE[15] has a value that is out of range.
         The valid range is from 30 to 60000 milliseconds.  If an invalid
         value is specified, the default time of 1000 ms is used. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the value of the predefined variable $TUNE[15] is within
         the valid range. 


29710  0-INFO Bad sysvar CRT display max lines 

       Cause:
         The predefined variable $TUNE[16] has a value that is out of range.
         The valid range is from 0 to 16 lines.  If an invalid value is
         specified, the default of 16 lines is used. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the value of the predefined variable $TUNE[16] is within
         the valid range. 


29711  0-INFO Display commands disabled 

       Cause:
         One of the DISPLAY group of commands has been issued when the
         $TUNE[15] value was set to 0, that means that the commands of this
         group are disabled. 

       Remedy:
         Set the value of $TUNE[15] to 1000, for enabling the DISPLAY
         refresh every second. 


29712  0-INFO Bad sysvar TP display max lines 

       Cause:
         The predefined variable $TUNE[17] has a value that is out of range.
         The valid range is from 0 to 10 lines.  If an invalid value is
         specified, the default of 10 lines is used. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the value of the predefined variable $TUNE[17] is within
         the valid range. 


29713  0-INFO Bad separator, use '-' or '..' 

       Cause:
         An invalid separator was used in the parameter string. 

       Remedy:
         Use a valid separator which is '..' for ranges and '-' for single
         numbers. 


29714  0-INFO Invalid parameter character 

       Cause:
         An invalid character was used in the parameter string. 

       Remedy:
         Check the parameter syntax in the manual. 


29715  0-INFO Two Arm windows already active; close one 

       Cause:
         The DISPLAY ARM (DA) command can work only on two windows at the
         same time. A DISPLAY ARM command was issued on another arm number
         with two arm windows already active. 

       Remedy:
         Close one of the arm windows with the DISPLAY CLOSE SELECT (DCS)
         command or close all the arm windows with the DISPLAY CLOSE ARM
         (DCA) command before reissuing the DISPLAY ARM command. 


29716  0-INFO FBus Master boards not present 

       Cause:
         The DISPLAY FIELDBUS MASTER (DFM) command was issued without any
         Fieldbus Master boards present. 

       Remedy:
         There is not a problem, the command automatically terminates. 


29717  0-INFO FBus Slave boards not present 

       Cause:
         The DISPLAY FIELDBUS SLAVE (DFS) command was issued without any
         Fieldbus Master boards present. 

       Remedy:
         There is not a problem, the command automatically terminates.

30720  2-WARNING Device <id> cannot be read 

       Cause:
         The specified device from which the user should be able to READ
         could not be found. This error occurs at initialization time when
         devices are searched for and analyzed. 

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


30721  2-WARNING Device <id> cannot be written to 

       Cause:
         The specified device to which the user should be able to WRITE
         could not be found. This error occurs at initialization time when
         devices are searched for and analyzed. 

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


30722  4-PAUSE Device type unknown 

       Cause:
         The device specified by the user is known but its type is unknown. 

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


30723  2-WARNING Write device <id> not found 

       Cause:
         The specified device could not be found at startup. 

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


30724  10-DRIVE OFF No memory for device table 

       Cause:
         There are insufficient memory resources for creating the device
         table. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the value of $NUM_DEVICES is not too large. 


30725  10-DRIVE OFF No memory for trace buffer 

       Cause:
         There are insufficient memory resources for creating the trace
         table. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the value of $NUM_TRACES is not too large. 


30726  0-INFO Already tracing 

       Cause:
         Tracing is already enabled so the reissue of the enable trace has
         no effect. 

       Remedy:
         This is only an informational message. 


30727  10-DRIVE OFF No memory for chain call 

       Cause:
         There are insufficient memory resources for creating the call chain
         information used in PROGRAM VIEW (PV). 

       Remedy:
         Remove code and/or data from memory and reissue the command. 


30728  2-WARNING Pulse of non active program 

       Cause:
         A PULSE completed after the program was deactivated and at the time
         of the deactivation the PULSE could not be canceled. 

       Remedy:
         This is only a warning. No action is needed. 


30729  4-PAUSE Bad HAND state 

       Cause:
         The requested HAND operation, due to a T1 or T2 TP key pressure,
         failed because the HAND is either in the RELAX or the Undefined
         state. This is due to the fact that T1 and T2 are used to toggle
         between the opened and the closed states only, while for the
         undefined and the relaxed state the the opposite state cannot be
         determined from the outputs. 

       Remedy:
         To correct this problem, explicitly change the state of the HAND by
         OPENing or CLOSing it (via a PDL2 statement or the "Hand
         Configuration Tool"). 


30730  4-PAUSE Bad HAND definition 

       Cause:
         The definition of the type of HAND on the arm is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Correct the definition of $HAND_TYPE for the specific arm. 


30731  10-DRIVE OFF General mapping failure 

       Cause:
         A mismatch has been detected in the I/O mapping tables. 

       Remedy:
         There is always another more significant error associated to this
         one. Follow the suggestions described in the remedy section of the
         associated error. 


30732  4-PAUSE Error in SYNCMOVE 

       Cause:
         An error occurred executing MOVE..SYNCMOVE statement. 

       Remedy:
         Check which is the error shown before this one and the related
         cause. 


30733  0-INFO 


30734  0-INFO 


30735  10-DRIVE OFF IOpnt <num> in group not mapped 

       Cause:
         An I/O point is defined in a group which is not associated to any
         device. 

       Remedy:
         Check that all I/O points that compose the group are properly
         associated to a device. Modify the mapping of I/O points via the
         suitable program IO_INST. 


30736  10-DRIVE OFF IOpnt <num> in group already mapped 

       Cause:
         The specific I/O point is defined as part of a group when it was
         already defined in a previous group. An I/O point can only pertain
         to one group. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the specific I/O point from one of the groups.

       Remedy:
         Check to see if any of the conditions are currently being used
         locally in a motion statement. 


30760  2-WARNING Bad port characteristics for MOUNT 

       Cause:
         While mounting certain protocols, the communication port
         characteristics are important.  This error occurs when one or more
         port characteristics are invalid for the protocol being mounted. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the port characteristics are correct for the specified
         protocol. 


30761  2-WARNING Profile already reset 

       Cause:
         The profiling was already reset so the PROGRAM TEST PROFILE RESET
         (PTPR) command has no effect. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


30762  2-WARNING Protocol already mounted 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to mount a protocol on a communication port and
         the port already contains the protocol. 

       Remedy:
         This is a warning. No action is necessary. 


30763  4-PAUSE Different protocol mounted 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to mount a protocol on a communication port
         which already contains a different protocol. 

       Remedy:
         Check that a protocol can be mounted on the specified device and
         that it does not already contain a protocol. If the communication
         port already contains a protocol, issue the UTILITY COMMUNICATION
         DISMOUNT (UCD) command and then reissue the MOUNT command. 


30764  2-WARNING No protocol mounted 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to dismount a protocol and either no protocol
         is mounted on the device or a protocol cannot be mounted on the
         device. 

       Remedy:
         Check the device name and that a protocol can be mounted. Check
         that no protocol is mounted by issuing the UTILITY COMMUNICATION
         VIEW (UCV) command on the device.

         valid parameters for the type of operation code specified. 


30767  4-PAUSE Bad DV_CNTRL data type 

       Cause:
         The data type of a parameter passed to the DV_CNTRL built-in
         routine is incorrect. 

       Remedy:
         Check the description of DV_CNTRL in the PDL2 Language Manual for
         parameter requirements for the type of operation code specified. 
         In particular check that the parameter is passed in the correct
         reference mode (i.e., by value or by reference). 


30768  4-PAUSE DV_CNTRL code not loaded 

       Cause:
         The system software for the requested DV_CNTRL operation is not
         loaded. 

       Remedy:

         DV_CNTRL operation. 

       Remedy:
         Remove some code or data from memory and reissue the DV_CNTRL
         operation. 


30771  10-DRIVE OFF Bad software load <sysdat 1> <sysdat 2> <sysdat 3> 

       Cause:
         There is a mismatch in the loaded software. The three numerical
         parameters contain internal system information which can be used to
         determine the exact cause. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the software was loaded correctly. Check for problems
         with the distribution devices.  If the problem still exists after a
         reload, contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com).

33793  2-WARNING ISR activated while editing 

       Cause:
         During an edit session an interrupt service routine (ISR) in a
         condition was triggered. The ISR was not executed. The user is
         prompted by the editor upon the next execution as to whether the
         ISR should be executed. 

       Remedy:
         It is only necessary to reply to the edit prompt. 


33794  12-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> cannot be contacted

         No action is necessary to clear this alarm. 


33796  2-WARNING Bad cycle time <value> 

       Cause:
         The value of the interpreter cycle time was badly set and could not
         be used. 

       Remedy:
         The system correctly adjusts the variable to a more meaningful
         value. The user does not need to take any action. 


33797  2-WARNING Bad cycle rate <value> 

       Cause:
         The value of the interpreter cycle rate or frequency, was badly set
         and could not be used. 

       Remedy:
         The system correctly adjusts the variable to a more meaningful
         value. The user does not need to take any action. 


33798  0-INFO Error <error_num> no known prog 

       Cause:
         An error which normally relates to a program occurred, but the
         corresponding program was not known due to the fact that it has
         either been deactivated or erased from memory. The parameter
         contains the program error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the program error and try to determine for what program this
         may have occurred. Then, take the appropriate action on that
         program. 


33799  0-INFO Error <error_num> no known prog <value> 

       Cause:
         An error which normally relates to a program occurred but the
         corresponding program was not known due to the fact that it has
         either been deactivated or erased from memory. The first parameter
         contains the program error and the second contains the parameter
         which would have applied to the program error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the program error and try to determine for what program this
         may have occurred. Then, take the appropriate action on that
         program. 


33800  0-INFO Error <error_num> no known prog <value> <value> 

       Cause:
         An error which normally relates to a program occurred but the
         corresponding program was not known due to the fact that it has
         either been deactivated or erased from memory. The first parameter
         contains the program error and the remaining parameters are the
         parameters which would have applied to the program error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the program error and try to determine for what program this
         may have occurred. Then, take the appropriate action on that
         program. 


33801  0-INFO Error <error_num> no known prog <value> <value> <value> 

       Cause:
         An error which normally relates to a program occurred but the
         corresponding program was not known due to the fact that it has
         either been deactivated or erased from memory. The first parameter
         contains the program error and the remaining parameters are the
         parameters which would have applied to the program error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the program error and try to determine for what program this
         may have occurred. Then, take the appropriate action on that
         program. 


33802  2-WARNING Execute already deactivated 

       Cause:
         A second command to deactivate the immediate mode execution program
         has been issued when the execution program has already been
         deactivated. This situation can occur when there are simultaneous
         deactivations of the immediate mode program. 

       Remedy:
         No action is necessary. This is only a warning. 


33803  2-WARNING Program has been deactivated 

       Cause:
         A second command to deactivate the edit session program has been
         issued when the program has already been deactivated. This
         situation can occur when there are simultaneous deactivations of
         the edit session program. 

       Remedy:
         No action is necessary. This is only a warning. 


33804  2-WARNING Bad state exiting MEMORY DEBUG 

       Cause:
         The MEMORY DEBUG environment is being exited and the state of the
         program or the internal communication is wrong. 

       Remedy:
         No action is necessary by the user. If this warning continues
         please report it to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


33805  2-WARNING All programs deactivated 

       Cause:
         The CTRL Y (^Y) has deactivated all activated programs. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


33806  2-WARNING ^Y only available in PROG state 

       Cause:
         Not all of the programs have been deactivated upon the CTRL Y (^Y). 

       Remedy:
         This can occur if the state of the system is protected. Unprotect
         the system before trying to deactivate all programs. 


33807  10-DRIVE OFF No memory for screen table 

       Cause:
         There are insufficient memory resources for creating the screen
         table. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the value of $NUM_SCRNS is not too large. 


33808  4-PAUSE Bad state for run 

       Cause:
         The state of the system is not suitable for execution. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the state of the system is in PROG.

35332  8-HOLD Error in writing of the transmission ring buffer 

       Cause:
         The queue of messages to be transmitted is not properly emptied:
         either the queue has been dimensioned with too few entries or an
         anomaly occurred in handling the signal of transmission interrupt. 

       Remedy:
         Contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


35333  8-HOLD Error in writing the reception ring buffer 

       Cause:
         The queue of CANOPen messages to be received is not properly
         emptied: either the queue has been dimensioned with too few entries
         or an anomaly occurred in handling the wake up of the task that
         empties the queue. 

       Remedy:
         Contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


35334  8-HOLD Error in writing the error ring buffer

35337  0-INFO 


36864  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ISR cannot unsuspend 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to change the state of a program from within an
         interrupt service routine (ISR) but the operation failed. This can
         occur either because of a bad ISR or because the ISR is already in
         the correct state. 

       Remedy:
         Check the program/ISR state change operation to determine if the
         program/ISR is already in the correct state. 


36865  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ISR limit exceeded 

       Cause:
         There is a limit of 255 interrupt service routines (ISR) per
         program. An ISR was triggered and the limit exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the ISR is not being recursively issued. 


36866  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ISR not loaded 

       Cause:
         The interrupt service routine (ISR) does not currently reside in
         memory. The ISR must be loaded at the time of the condition handler
         definition and must remain in memory until the referencing
         condition handler is purged. 

       Remedy:
         Load the program which contains the routine. 


36867  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ISR not exec as prog deac 

       Cause:
         An interrupt service routine (ISR) was issued after the program has
         been completed and deactivated.  The state of the program is either
         deactivated or waiting for end of motion before completing. 

       Remedy:
         Do not cause an ISR to be triggered after the program has
         completed. 


36868  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ISR prog not active 

       Cause:
         The program was no longer active when an interrupt service routine
         (ISR) was issued. This can occur when a condition handler is
         triggered at the same time that the program is deactivated. 

       Remedy:
         Do not cause an ISR to be triggered at the same time the program is
         being deactivated. 


36869  4-PAUSE <id_prog>(<num_linea>): Bad CYCLE time specified 

       Cause:
         The time specified with the CYCLE statement is either invalid or
         has not been interpreted. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the time specified is greater than or equal to zero
         and that the CYCLE statement has been executed. 


36870  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for mtn built-in 

       Cause:
         Motion built-ins such as POS_TO_JNTP require the use of shared
         memory. The built-in failed because no memory resources could be
         found. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory to see if there is sufficient
         shared memory. 


36871  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for Servo
       communication 

       Cause:
         Communication between the robot CPUs failed due to a shortage of
         shared memory. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory to see if there is sufficient
         shared memory. 


36872  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for cond 

       Cause:
         The definition of a condition handler failed due to insufficient
         memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or erase something from
         memory. 


36873  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for cond com 

       Cause:
         Communication between the interpreter and the condition handler
         failed due to insufficient memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or erase something from
         memory. 


36874  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for SYS_CALL 

       Cause:
         Issuing a SYS_CALL failed due to insufficient memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or erase something from
         memory. 


36875  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for DELAY 

       Cause:
         Issuing a DELAY failed due to insufficient memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or erase something from
         memory. 


36876  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for PULSE 

       Cause:
         Issuing a PULSE failed due to insufficient memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or erase something from
         memory. 


36877  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for READ 

       Cause:
         Issuing a READ failed due to insufficient memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or erase something from
         memory. 


36878  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): prog out of memory 

       Cause:
         Insufficient PDL2 program memory for adding the trappable error. 
         This occurs when calling the ERR_TRAP_ON built-in. 

       Remedy:
         Review which errors have already been trapped and either remove
         some of them or increase the size of the PDL2 program stack,
         because the trappable errors are added to the stack space. 


36879  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): <error_num> err(s) deactivating 

       Cause:
         During the deactivation of the program, certain errors occurred. 

       Remedy:
         Review the preceding error messages to determine what errors
         occurred and take the necessary action based on these errors. 


36880  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad deac of sys_call 

       Cause:
         During the deactivation of the program there was a problem in
         handling the canceling of the outstanding SYS_CALL. 

       Remedy:
         Please report this error to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36881  4-PAUSE %s(%d): expression only allowed with Emotion 

       Cause:
         This kind of expression is only allowed when the Emotion option is
         enabled. 

       Remedy:
         Please enable the Emotion option or change the expression which
         defines the condition. 


36882  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): many errors in deac 

       Cause:
         During the deactivation of the program there were too many problems
         for the deactivation process to continue. 

       Remedy:
         Please report this error to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36883  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): mtn line <line_num> canceled 

       Cause:
         The motion statement of the specified line was canceled. 

       Remedy:
         This is an informational message. 


36884  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mtn line <line_num> has err
       <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The motion statement of the specified line contained an error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the error to determine what action to take. 


36885  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mtn line <line_num> canc err
       <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The motion statement of the specified line contained an error and
         the motion was canceled. 

       Remedy:
         Review the error to determine what action to take. 


36886  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm <arm_num> mtn not RESUMEd as
       locked 

       Cause:
         The RESUME operation failed because the arm was locked. 

       Remedy:
         Determine which program has locked the arm and either issue a
         corresponding UNLOCK or deactivate the program.  The deactivation
         process automatically UNLOCKs the arm. 


36887  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> mtn not RESUMEd 

       Cause:
         The RESUME operation failed due to the specified error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the error to determine what action to take. 


36888  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm <arm_num> and data <value>
       mismatch 

       Cause:
         The arm specified in a motion built-in does not correspond with the
         JOINTPOS or XTNDPOS variable's arm number. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the arm number of the variable is the same as the arm
         number specified in the built-in. 


36889  0-INFO 


36890  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): already interpreting motion 

       Cause:
         A program can only interpret one MOVE statement at a time. This
         error occurs if the program attempts to interpret a second MOVE
         statement before the first one has completed.  This situation can
         occur if a routine or ISR contains a motion statement and is called
         during the processing of the MOVE statement. It is important to
         differentiate between the interpretation of the statement and the
         interpolation of the motion. 

       Remedy:
         Change the MOVE statement to a single line statement or do not
         issue motions from ISRs. 


36891  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no arm <arm_num> 

       Cause:
         The arm specified in a statement does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the arm specified in the statement does exist. 


36892  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no servo board <servo_num> 

       Cause:
         The referenced servo control board in the HDIN_SET built-in does
         not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the parameter to the HDIN_SET built-in is correct and
         that there is a corresponding DSA board. 


36893  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm <arm_num> already used 

       Cause:
         The arm is already referenced in the multiple arm statement. An
         SYNCMOVE has been issued on the same arm. For example, - -  PROGRAM
         armusd PROG_ARM=1 -  . . . -    MOVE TO $HOME SYNCMOVE ARM[1] TO
         $CAL_SYS - Note that the motion to $HOME uses the default program
         arm which is arm 1.  Therefore, arm 1 has been referenced twice in
         the same statement. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the arm numbers specified in the MOVE/SYNCMOVE
         statements are unique and check the value of the default program
         arm ($PROG_ARM). 


36894  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): all motion buffers used 

       Cause:
         Insufficient resources for issuing a motion because all motion
         buffers are currently used. 

       Remedy:
         Try  increasing the number of motion buffers ($NUM_MB). 


36895  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm <arm_num> does not exist 

       Cause:
         The arm specified, for example as PROG_ARM attribute, does not
         exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check the controller configuration, the PROG_ARM attribute, and the
         system default arm ($DFT_ARM) to be sure that there is such an arm. 


36896  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): issuing prog is not loaded 

       Cause:
         The program which issued the ACTIVATE statement or action no longer
         exists and therefore the program cannot be activated. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the issuer of the ACTIVATE does exist. 


36897  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): holdable statement in nohold prog 

       Cause:
         A NOHOLD program cannot interpret HOLDable statements such as MOVE
         and LOCK. This error occurs when an external routine containing a
         HOLDable statement has been called from a NOHOLD program. 

       Remedy:
         Change either the external routine or the attribute of the program. 


36898  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): stack full 

       Cause:
         The PDL2 program stack has become full. This can occur for many
         reasons. The most common cause is that the level of routine calls
         is too deep; too many errors are trapped on; or the size of a
         routine local variable set is too large. 

       Remedy:
         Determine the cause and either reduce the burden on the stack or
         increase the stack size specified in the STACK program attribute. 


36899  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): stack empty 

       Cause:
         There is insufficient data on the stack. 

       Remedy:
         Please report this error to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36900  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mtn event limit reached 

       Cause:
         The maximum number of 8 motion events for a motion segment has been
         exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Reduce the number of motion events on the particular motion
         segment. 


36901  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad mtn event for $MOVE_TYPE 

       Cause:
         The type of motion event does not match the type of motion. 
         Cartesian motions (LINEAR and CIRCULAR) cannot use the PERCENT
         event and a joint motion (JOINT) cannot use the DISTANCE event. 

       Remedy:
         Change the type of motion or the motion event. 


36902  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad local cond operation 

       Cause:
         The operation, such as the implicit ENABLE at the start of the
         motion or implicit DISABLE at the end of the motion, failed on a
         local condition handler. 

       Remedy:
         Please report this error to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36903  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): local cond limit reached 

       Cause:
         A condition handler can only be used locally in 15 different motion
         segments at one time. 

       Remedy:
         Check the use of this condition handler and reduce the number of
         active motion statements which reference it. 


36904  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad TIL cond 

       Cause:
         The motion events STOP, RESUME, AT START, and AT END cannot be used
         in the TIL clause. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the offending motion events from the TIL clause expression. 


36905  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WITH cond limit reached 

       Cause:
         The maximum number (8) of local condition handlers in a MOVE
         statement has been exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Reduce the number of local condition handlers and if necessary add
         condition expressions in a single condition handler. 


36906  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad mtn event parameter 

       Cause:
         The value specified in a motion event is invalid. The limits for
         the PERCENT motion event is 1 to 100.  For the TIME and DISTANCE
         motion events the value must be greater than 0. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the specified value. 


36907  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad IN frame specification 

       Cause:
         The type of frame specified in a MOVE RELATIVE or MOVE ABOUT
         statement is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check the frame specification in the statement.  The valid frames
         are TOOL and BASE. 


36908  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): MOVE statement in CONDITION 

       Cause:
         A motion statement cannot be interpreted at the same time as a
         condition handler. This error can occur if a routine which contains
         a motion statement is called while a condition handler definition
         is being interpreted. 

       Remedy:
         Modify the program so that the routine which contains a motion is
         not called during a condition handler definition. 


36909  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): circular MOVE requires the VIA
       clause or VIA without circular 

       Cause:
         The VIA clause is required in circular moves or a VIA clause has
         been specified without MOVE_TYPE of circular. 

       Remedy:
         Modify the statement adding or removing the VIA clause accordingly
         to the type of motion ($MOVE_TYPE). 


36910  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad arm or hand number 

       Cause:
         The hand number or arm number specified in the OPEN, CLOSE, or
         RELAX HAND statement is invalid. There is a limit of two hands per
         arm. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the specified arm and hand numbers. 


36911  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): hand type not defined 

       Cause:
         The type of HAND has not been specified. There are currently four
         types of HANDs: Single, Dual, Pulse and Step. 

       Remedy:
         Check the type of HAND and set it to a valid type by setting the
         predefined variable $HAND_TYPE or by using the I/O configuration
         tool in the section related to the HAND configuration. 


36912  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): unmatching FOR loop 

       Cause:
         The FOR and ENDFOR statements do not match.  This error occurs if a
         FOR .. ENDFOR loop is exited or entered using a GOTO statement. 

       Remedy:
         Do not jump into and out of FOR loops. 


36913  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): failure closing the lun 

       Cause:
         The closing of a LUN (CLOSE FILE) operation has failed. 

       Remedy:
         Please report to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36914  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad write type 

       Cause:
         A variable of such a data type cannot be written.  The valid data
         types are INTEGER, REAL, BOOLEAN, STRING, VECTOR, POSITION,
         JOINTPOS and XTNDPOS. 

       Remedy:
         Check what type of data is being referenced in the WRITE statement
         and modify the variable reference accordingly. 


36915  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): write format too long 

       Cause:
         The format specified for an item in a WRITE statement is too long. 

       Remedy:
         Reduce the format size. 


36916  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): writing value not initialized 

       Cause:
         The variable being written has not been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Either modify the variable such that it contains a valid value or
         modify the WRITE statement. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used to
         determine if the value of a variable has been initialized. 


36917  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad <format> 1st READ format 

       Cause:
         The first READ format specifier on a variable is invalid. The
         following example is invalid since 9999 is too large for the first
         specifier: - -  READ lun (i::9999) - 

       Remedy:
         Check and correct the value of the first format specifier. 


36918  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad <format> 2nd READ format 

       Cause:
         The second READ format specifier on a variable is invalid. The
         following example is invalid since a second specifier cannot be
         specified with REALs. - -  VAR r : REAL -  . . . -  READ lun
         (r::5::1) 

       Remedy:
         Check and correct the value of the second format specifier. 


36919  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): READ request used 

       Cause:
         A READ has been issued on a LUN which has entered an invalid state. 

       Remedy:
         Please report to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36920  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad baud rate specified 

       Cause:
         The baud rate specified in the COM_PORT_SET built-in or at the
         command level is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter in the built-in or at the command
         level. 


36921  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad device name 

       Cause:
         The device name specified is invalid. Device names can be up to 4
         alphanumeric characters in length and must end with a colon ":". 
         For example, COM1: and CRT2: are valid device names. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the device name specified. 


36922  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad OPEN FILE access mode 

       Cause:
         The access mode specified in the OPEN FILE statement is invalid.
         This could be due to an invalid character (e.g., 'RX'), a character
         specified twice (e.g., 'RWR') or an invalid operation for the type
         of device (e.g., "OPEN FILE lun ('CRT2:', 'RA')" because one cannot
         append to a window device. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the access string and/or the type of device. Refer
         to the PDL2 Language Manual for a complete description of the OPEN
         FILE access string. 


36923  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad lun count 

       Cause:
         The number of files opened on a device is counted. This error
         occurs if this counter has gone wrong. 

       Remedy:
         Please report to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36924  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad lun index 

       Cause:
         The LUN index specified in a file access statement (a READ, WRITE,
         or CLOSE FILE) is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the LUN is open and can be accessed by this program. 


36925  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad device operation 

       Cause:
         The operation attempted on the particular device is invalid. There
         are 5 types of devices: null, window, file, serial line and serial
         line with a mounted protocol. The type of operation (e.g., FILER
         COPY or WIN_DEL) that can be performed is checked by the system.
         Some operations are not allowed on ports having a specific protocol
         mounted. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify either the device specified or the type of
         operation. 


36926  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad LUN access 

       Cause:
         The access to a LUN is invalid. This can be either because of an
         invalid LUN number specified in the statement or because the LUN is
         no longer active and has been closed. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the LUN is still open and that the integer variable is
         valid. 


36927  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): device ATTACHed or used 

       Cause:
         An operation was attempted on a device which is attached. Devices
         are either explicitly attached by using the ATTACH statement or
         implicitly attached when a protocol is mounted. 

       Remedy:
         Check who has issued the ATTACH and determine if this is necessary. 


36928  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): device table full 

       Cause:
         There is a finite number of devices which can exist at the same
         time. This error reports that the limit has been reached. 

       Remedy:
         Check that unused windows are deleted and if the problem still
         exists increase the default number of devices ($NUM_DEVICES). 


36929  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): file name required 

       Cause:
         A file has tried to be opened on a device which requires a file
         name. The following example requires a file name: - - OPEN FILE
         lunidx ('rd:', 'r') - 

       Remedy:
         Specify the file name. 


36930  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): file operation err <error_num> 

       Cause:
         A file operation failed with the specified error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the file operation error to determine a corrective action. 


36931  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): file not closed as SYS_CALL_OUT lun 

       Cause:
         The file could not be closed as it is currently being used in a
         SYS_CALL. 

       Remedy:
         Wait until the SYS_CALL has completed before trying to close the
         file. 


36932  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): lun table full 

       Cause:
         There is a finite number of files which can be open at the same
         time. This error reports that the limit has been reached. 

       Remedy:
         Check that unused files are closed.  If the problem still exists
         increase the default number of LUNs ($NUM_LUNS). Increasing the
         number of LUNs does use extra memory and system resources so it is
         recommended to close unused files as opposed to just increasing the
         number of available LUNs. 


36933  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no such device 

       Cause:
         The specified device does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the device name is correct and that the physical device
         does exist. 


36934  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no space for delimiter table 

       Cause:
         Opening a file specifying a delimiter (e.g., "OPEN FILE lunidx
         ("CRT:", "r") WITH $FL_DMT = 65") does use memory. This error
         occurs when there is insufficient memory resources for defining the
         delimiter table. 

       Remedy:
         Check the system configuration and try to free up some memory
         resources, for example by erasing unneeded programs and/or data
         from memory. 


36935  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): not device owner 

       Cause:
         An attempt to DETACH a device failed as the program which issued
         the DETACH does not currently own the device. 

       Remedy:
         Only the program which issued the ATTACH can issue the DETACH.
         Check that the two are the same. 


36936  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): current data locked 

       Cause:
         Access to the current arm data ($CRNT_DATA) is locked. 

       Remedy:
         Please report to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36937  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad arm number 

       Cause:
         The arm specified in the built-in ARM_POS, ARM_JNTP or ARM_XTND is
         invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the arm specified does exist. 


36938  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm not calibrated 

       Cause:
         The arm is currently not calibrated and therefore the attempted
         operation failed. 

       Remedy:
         Calibrate the arm and reissue the statement or action. 


36939  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): integer not initialized 

       Cause:
         The INTEGER variable accessed has either not been initialized or
         was initialized and then set uninit again when an operation such as
         READ failed on the variable. The variable cannot be used until it
         has been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the variable has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable and the variable can be
         initialized as part of the declaration (e.g., "VAR i : INTEGER
         (55)"). 


36940  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): real not initialized 

       Cause:
         The REAL variable accessed has either not been initialized or was
         initialized and then set uninit when an operation such as READ
         failed on the variable.  The variable cannot be used until it has
         been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the variable has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable and the variable can be
         initialized as part of the declaration (e.g., "VAR pi : REAL
         (3.14159)"). 


36941  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): boolean not initialized 

       Cause:
         The BOOLEAN variable accessed has either not been initialized or
         was initialized and then set uninit when an operation such as READ
         failed on the variable.  The variable cannot be used until it has
         been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the variable has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable and the variable can be
         initialized as part of the declaration (e.g., "VAR
         i_want_to_go_home : BOOLEAN (TRUE)"). 


36942  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): string not initialized 

       Cause:
         The STRING variable accessed: * ** 1: has an undefined length, **
         2: has not been initialized, or ** 3: was initialized and then set
         uninit when an operation such as READ *     failed on the variable.
         * The variable cannot be used until it has been properly
         initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the string length has been defined, that the variable
         has been initialized, and that no error has occurred on the
         variable. The built-in STR_LEN can be used for checking the string
         length. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for checking the state
         of the variable and the variable can be initialized as part of the
         declaration (e.g., "VAR s : STRING[80] ('I do like to be beside the
         seaside')"). 


36943  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): vector not initialized 

       Cause:
         The VECTOR variable accessed has either not been initialized or was
         initialized and then set uninit when an operation such as READ
         failed on the variable.  The variable cannot be used until it has
         been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the variable has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable. 


36944  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): position not initialized 

       Cause:
         The POSITION variable accessed has either not been initialized or
         was initialized and then set uninit when an operation such as READ
         failed on the variable.  The variable cannot be used until it has
         been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the variable has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable. 


36945  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): jointpos not initialized 

       Cause:
         The JOINTPOS variable accessed has either not been initialized or
         was initialized and then set uninit when an operation such as READ
         failed on the variable.  The variable cannot be used until it has
         been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the variable has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable. 


36946  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): xtndpos not initialized 

       Cause:
         The XTNDPOS variable accessed has either not been initialized or
         was initialized and then set uninit when an operation such as READ
         failed on the variable.  The variable cannot be used until it has
         been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the variable has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable. 


36947  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> in action. Cond
       <cond_num> not completed 

       Cause:
         The actions of the specified condition handler did not complete due
         to the specified error. For example, the action "ENABLE
         CONDITION[99]" was specified but condition handler 99 does not
         exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check the particular error and modify the condition handler. 


36948  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): cond being defined in cond 

       Cause:
         A condition handler cannot be defined while another condition
         handler is being defined.  For example: - -  . . . -  ROUTINE rout
         -  BEGIN -    CONDITION[2]: -      WHEN HOLD DO -      . . . -   
         ENDCONDITION -  END rout - -  BEGIN -    . . . -    CONDITION[1]: -
         WHEN HOLD DO -        $FDOUT[rout] := ON -      . . . -   
         ENDCONDITION - would fail as condition handler 2 cannot be defined
         while condition handler 1 is being defined. 

       Remedy:
         Modify the program such that condition handlers are not defined
         during the definition of another condition handler. 


36949  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> <number> cond(s) not
       PURGE 

       Cause:
         The PURGE action or statement failed due to the error specified. A
         typical error could be caused by purging a condition handler that
         is currently locally enabled. For example, the PURGE statement
         would fail in the following statement since the motion statement is
         using the condition handler: - -  MOVEFLY TO p1 WITH CONDITION[1]
         ADVANCE -  PURGE CONDITION[1] - 

       Remedy:
         Do not attempt to PURGE a condition handler until it is no longer
         referenced. 


36950  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no cond <cond_num> in cond
       <cond_num> 

       Cause:
         The PURGE action failed in the specified condition handler because
         the condition handler is not defined. For example, - -  . . . - 
         BEGIN -    CONDITION[1]: -      WHEN HOLD DO -        PURGE
         CONDITION[2] -- CH 2 does not exist -    ENDCONDITION 

       Remedy:
         Check to be sure the condition handler number is correct and that
         the condition handler has not already been purged. 


36951  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): I/O table full cond not enabled 

       Cause:
         The number of I/O events (eg. WHEN $DIN[1]+) is limited. This error
         occurs when the limit is reached. 

       Remedy:
         Check that all the I/O events are necessary and are being used. 
         Delete all unnecessary I/O events. 


36952  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): cond contains mtn events 

       Cause:
         The condition handler could not be enabled as it contains certain
         types of motion events.  For example, - -  . . . -    CONDITION[1]:
         -      WHEN TIME 100 BEFORE END DO -        HOLD -    ENDCONDITION
         - -    ENABLE CONDITION[1] 

       Remedy:
         Change the condition handler such that it does not contain any of
         the TIME, PERCENT, DISTANCE or AT VIA motion events. The motion
         events AT START, AT END, STOP and RESUME are allowed to be enabled
         globally. 


36953  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no such condition 

       Cause:
         The condition handler referenced in the ENABLE, DISABLE, or PURGE
         statement/action, or in the WITH clause does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the condition handler number is correct and if so check
         that the condition handler has been defined. 


36954  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): condition too large 

       Cause:
         The number of condition expressions has been exceeded. The current
         limit is 254 expressions. 

       Remedy:
         Split the condition in two or many smaller conditions. 


36955  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad cond number <cond_num> 

       Cause:
         The condition handler number is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Change the condition handler number to a valid number in the range
         1 to 255. 


36956  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): holdable action 

       Cause:
         Programs with NOHOLD attribute cannot use condition handlers which
         contain actions related to motion such as LOCK, UNLOCK, CANCEL
         CURRENT, and CANCEL ALL. 

       Remedy:
         Change the program attribute to HOLD or change the condition
         handler definition so that it does not contain  actions related to
         motion. 


36957  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm and jntp mismatch 

       Cause:
         The JOINTPOS data is not valid for the particular arm specified in
         the MOVE statement. The following example will cause this error
         since the data is for arm 2 but the motion is for arm 3: - -  . . .
         -  VAR j1 : JOINTPOS FOR ARM[2] -  . . . -  BEGIN -    MOVE ARM[3]
         TO j1 -- Data for arm 2. Motion on arm 3. 

       Remedy:
         Change either the variable declaration or the motion statement,
         reteaching the data if necessary. 


36958  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm and xtnd mismatch 

       Cause:
         The XTNDPOS data is not valid for the particular arm specified in
         the MOVE statement. The following example will cause this error
         since the motion is for arm 3 and the data is for arm 2: - -  . . .
         -  VAR x1 : XTNDPOS FOR ARM[2] -  . . . -  BEGIN -    MOVE ARM[3]
         TO x1 -- Data for arm 2. Motion on arm 3. 

       Remedy:
         Change either the variable declaration or the motion statement,
         reteaching the data if necessary. 


36959  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no joint <joint_num>[<max>] 

       Cause:
         A reference has been made to a JOINTPOS axis (jntvar[n]) that does
         not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the index does reference a valid axis. The predefined
         variables $NUM_JNT_AXES and $JNT_MASK contain information on the
         number of axes and the presence of the different axes. 


36960  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WITH idx <index> limit <max> 

       Cause:
         The first index of a variable in a WITH clause does not exist. For
         example - -    MOVE TO p1 WITH $JNT_OVR[99]=89 -- No such axis 99.
         - 

       Remedy:
         Change the program such that a valid index is referenced. 


36961  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WITH idx <index> limits
       <dim1_max>,<dim2_max> 

       Cause:
         The second index of a variable in a WITH clause does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Change the program such that a valid index is referenced. 


36962  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): 1st idx <index> limit <max> 

       Cause:
         The first index of a variable is outside the range. For example - -
         VAR a : ARRAY[10] OF INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -    . . . -   
         a[11] := 99 -- Element 11 does not exist 

       Remedy:
         Change the program such that a valid element is referenced. 


36963  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): 2nd idx <index> limit <max> 

       Cause:
         The second index of a variable is outside the range. For example -
         -  . . . -  VAR b : ARRAY[5, 10] OF INTEGER -  . . . -  BEGIN -   
         . . . -    b [4, 11] := 99 -- Element [4, 11] does not exist 

       Remedy:
         Change the program such that a valid element is referenced. 


36964  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): copy array size mismatch 

       Cause:
         The assignment between two ARRAY variables failed because the size
         of the two arrays is not equal. 

       Remedy:
         Either change the size of the arrays such that they are equal or
         copy each element one at a time using a FOR loop. 


36965  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm mismatch in jointpos assigment 

       Cause:
         The assignment between two JOINTPOS variables failed because the
         arm numbers are not the same. 

       Remedy:
         Either change the arm number of the JOINTPOS variables in the
         declaration or copy each element one at a time using a FOR loop. 


36966  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm mismatch in xtndpos assignment 

       Cause:
         The assignment between two XTNDPOS variables failed because the arm
         numbers are not the same. 

       Remedy:
         Either change the arm number of the XTNDPOS variables in the
         declaration or copy the position field (POS) and auxiliary axes
         field (AUX) in separate assignment statements. 


36967  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm mismatch in arrays 

       Cause:
         The assignment between two ARRAYs of either XTNDPOS or JOINTPOS
         variables failed because the arm numbers are not the same. 

       Remedy:
         Either change the arm number of the variables in the declaration or
         copy individual elements and fields separately. 


36968  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): routine not loaded 

       Cause:
         The exported routine is not currently loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Load in memory (ML) the owning program. 


36969  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): missing RETURN in function 

       Cause:
         A function routine has completed without a RETURN statement. The
         following example will cause this error since the function "rout"
         does not contain a RETURN statement. - -  ROUTINE rout : INTEGER - 
         BEGIN -    -- Should be a RETURN statement between -    -- the
         BEGIN and END statements -    WRITE('Inside the routine', NL) - 
         END rout - 

       Remedy:
         Either change the routine to a procedure with no return result or
         add a RETURN statement. 


36970  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): HDIN_SET, prog attr in conflict with
       LOCK 

       Cause:
         The HDIN_SET built-in is called by a NOHOLD program and the
         built-in contains the  action to LOCK the arm when the input is
         triggered.  LOCKing of an arm can only be done by a HOLDable
         program. 

       Remedy:
         Either change the program attribute to HOLD or do not attempt to
         LOCK the arm using HDIN_SET. 


36971  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): str for cnfg too short 

       Cause:
         The conversion of the POSITION configuration data from a number to
         a string failed because the STRING was too short. 

       Remedy:
         Please report to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36972  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad cnfg string 

       Cause:
         The specified positional configuration string is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Review the configuration string, removing invalid parameters. 


36973  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): at breakpoint <num> 

       Cause:
         A breakpoint in the program has been reached and the program state
         is changed to READY. 

       Remedy:
         To continue execution for a NOHOLDable program, press the RUN key.
         For HOLDable programs, press the START key. The breakpoint can be
         removed by issuing the proper command from TP pages or from the
         system command (PTBP). 


36974  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad data type to routine 

       Cause:
         The data type of the variable passed to the routine is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Change the variable passed to the statement. 


36975  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): system variable locked 

       Cause:
         The predefined variable accessed by the routine is currently locked
         and therefore cannot be accessed. 

       Remedy:
         Reissue the statement or try to determine why it is locked. 


36976  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $SYS_CALL_OUT not owned by this prog 

       Cause:
         The LUN specified in $SYS_CALL_OUT is either not owned by this
         program or is not a system LUN. 

       Remedy:
         Check and change what has been assigned to $SYS_CALL_OUT. 


36977  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $SYS_CALL_TOUT timer error 

       Cause:
         There are a finite number of timer resources. The SYS_CALL with a
         timeout failed because the limit has been exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Either reissue the command or reduce the amount of concurrent
         statements with timeouts. 


36978  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> in pass of READ 

       Cause:
         The BYPASS over a READ statement failed due to the specified error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


36979  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> in pass of WAIT 

       Cause:
         The BYPASS over a WAIT statement failed due to the specified error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


36980  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): pass of WAIT FOR failed 

       Cause:
         The BYPASS over a WAIT FOR statement failed due to the specified
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


36981  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): pass of SYS_CALL failed 

       Cause:
         The BYPASS over a SYS_CALL statement failed due to the specified
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


36982  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): pass of DELAY failed 

       Cause:
         The BYPASS over a DELAY statement failed due to the specified
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


36983  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): EXIT CYCLE, problems in deac
       phase 

       Cause:
         The EXIT CYCLE statement or action failed due to some problems in
         the deactivation phase. EXIT CYCLE is very similar to a
         deactivation and an activation and therefore the above errors are
         very similar to those which can occur in the deactivation of a
         program. 

       Remedy:
         Please report to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


36984  2-WARNING <exec_prog> err <error_num> ext rout <rout_id> prog
       <owning_prog> line <line_num> 

       Cause:
         This message is informational and specifies at what line and in
         what routine a previous error occurred in the program, when the
         execution is in an external routine. 

       Remedy:
         Review the error number to determine what action to take. 


36985  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no timer resource for DELAY 

       Cause:
         There are a finite number of timer resources. The DELAY statement
         failed because the limit has been exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Either reissue the command or reduce the number of concurrent
         statements that use timers. 


36986  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no timer resource for PULSE 

       Cause:
         There are a finite number of timer resources. The PULSE statement
         failed because the limit has been exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Either reissue the command or reduce the number of concurrent
         statements that use timers. 


36987  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no timer resource for HAND 

       Cause:
         There are a finite number of timer resources. The HAND statement
         failed because the limit has been exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Either reissue the command or reduce the number of concurrent
         statements that use timers. 


36988  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no timer resources for READ 

       Cause:
         There are a finite number of timer resources. The READ statement
         with a timeout failed because the limit has been exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Either reissue the command or reduce the number of concurrent
         statements that use timers. 


36989  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad WIN_LOAD file 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to WIN_LOAD a file onto a window and the format
         of the file was not correct. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the file was created using WIN_SAVE. 


36990  0-INFO 


36991  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mtn frame not initialized 

       Cause:
         $BASE and $TOOL are set to uninit values. 

       Remedy:
         Verify that $BASE and $TOOL are correctly initialized in the
         program. 


36992  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): jntp not initialized 

       Cause:
         The JOINTPOS variable specified in a MOVE statement has not been
         initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Initialize the JOINTPOS before issuing the MOVE. 


36993  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): pos not initialized 

       Cause:
         The POSITION variable specified in a MOVE statement has not been
         initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Initialize the POSITION before issuing the MOVE. 


36994  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): pos out of range 

       Cause:
         The arm cannot move to a position located out of the robot
         workspace. 

       Remedy:
         Move to a position inside the robot workspace. 


36995  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 1 at undefined position 

       Cause:
         The arm has the center of the wrist aligned with the 'z' axis of
         the world frame. This is an arm singularity. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid entering the center of the wrist in a cylindrical volume
         coaxial to the z-axis. 


36996  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): wrist axis at undefined position 

       Cause:
         The wrist has axis 5 at zero position. For this wrist, it is
         impossible to independently compute the values of axes 4, 5, and 6. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid working in Cartesian space with axis 5 at zero position or,
         if implemented, change the setting of $ORNT_TYPE to WRIST_JNT in
         order to execute the trajectory in Cartesian, but interpolate the
         wrist axes in joint. 


36997  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): function not yet implemented 

       Cause:
         The function is not yet implemented. 

       Remedy:
         Wait for a next software release. 


36998  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad circular trajectory 

       Cause:
         The system is trying to execute a CIRCULAR motion where the
         trajectory is not well defined. This error can occur if two points
         (starting and VIA, or ending and VIA)  are coincident. 

       Remedy:
         Check the values of the two points. 


36999  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad positional cnfg flag 

       Cause:
         When executing a Cartesian move, the configuration of the robot at
         the END point has to be the same as at the START point. If this is
         not true and if $CNFG_CARE is set to TRUE, this error will HOLD the
         system. If $CNFG_CARE is set to FALSE the robot will move to the
         END point with the same configuration as the START point. 

       Remedy:
         If configuration is not important, set $CNFG_CARE to FALSE. 


37000  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): VIA point not set 

       Cause:
         A circular trajectory applies to the motion statement but the VIA
         point has not been specified. 

       Remedy:
         Either specify the VIA point or change the kind of trajectory. 


37001  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): inverse kinematics not available 

       Cause:
         This machine does not have the inverse kinematics. 

       Remedy:
         Do not try to work in Cartesian. 


37002  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): stroke end axis 1+ 

       Cause:
         The robot cannot reach a position where axis 1 is over its positive

       Cause:
         During the last operation many errors occurred, some of which were
         not program specific. 

       Remedy:
         Review the preceding error messages to determine what action should
         be taken. 


37055  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): error <error_num> in prog 

       Cause:
         A non-EC_PROG or EC_TRAP class of error occurred in a program. This
         error message states what the error was and to which program it
         applies. 

       Remedy:
         Review the preceding error messages to determine what action should
         be taken. 


37056  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): prog error <error_par> 

       Cause:
         A non-EC_PROG or EC_TRAP class of error occurred in a program. This
         error message states the error, the parameters to the error, and to
         which program it applies. 

       Remedy:

37059  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): MOVE FOR distance too short 

       Cause:
         The linear distance on the trajectory is too small to compute the
         new parameters. 

       Remedy:
         Increase the linear distance on the trajectory or change the move
         type. 


37060  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): MOVE FOR distance too long 

       Cause:
         The linear distance on the trajectory is greater than the total
         distance for the move. 

       Remedy:
         Limit the linear distance on the trajectory to the total distance
         available for this move. 


37061  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mtn canc bad target position 

       Cause:
         The interpolator itself and/or the servo control detects an
         interpolator error which has caused a generation of targets out of
         the limits. The error depends on the arm position and the
         operations which are requested on this position. The current motion
         has been canceled due to this error. 

       Remedy:
         Verify that the arm is near a singularity point. If possible, avoid
         Cartesian moves near singularity points.  If the arm is far from
         the singularity point, please report the error and the generation
         history to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com).

       Cause:
         The WIN_CREATE built-in failed because the device already exists. 

       Remedy:
         If the device which already exists is a user created window this
         can be removed and deleted, thereby allowing the new window with
         the same name to be created. If the device is not a user created
         window or the user created window cannot be deleted, change the
         name of the device.

37065  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): OPEN FILE bad delimiter number 

       Cause:
         The number assigned to $FL_DLMT in the OPEN FILE statement is
         invalid. 

       Remedy:
         The valid range is from -1 to 255. 


37066  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): OPEN FILE bad number of chars 

       Cause:
         The number assigned to $FL_NUM_CHARS in the OPEN FILE statement is
         invalid. 

       Remedy:
         The valid range is from 1 to 80. 


37067  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad READ binary specified 

       Cause:
         The OPEN FILE .. WITH $FL_BINARY=TRUE failed as binary access is
         not allowed on the particular device. 

       Remedy:
         Determine which operations can be performed on the different
         devices. 


37068  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad CLOSE FILE prog not owner 

       Cause:
         A program attempted to close a file LUN (CLOSE FILE) which it does
         not own. LUNs can only be closed by the program which issued the
         OPEN FILE. 

       Remedy:
         Make the owning program close the file. 


37069  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad condition definition 

       Cause:
         The condition handler definition is invalid because either * ** 1:
         no condition expressions or actions have been specified ** 2: the
         number of actions is too large ** 3: the condition handler is
         currently attached ** 4: the condition handler is currently locally
         enabled * 

       Remedy:
         Check that the condition handler does contain actions and condition
         expressions and not too many. If so, split into many smaller
         condition handlers. 


37070  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad EVENT number 

       Cause:
         The event number specified in the EVENT condition expression is
         invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the EVENT number in the WHEN clause is correct and
         modify accordingly.  Refer to the "Condition Handlers" chapter of
         the PDL2 Language Manual for a list of valid EVENT numbers. 


37071  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 5 at undefined position 

       Cause:
         The wrist has axis 5 at an undefined position. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid working in Cartesian with axis 5 at this undefined position. 
         If implemented, change the setting of $ORNT_TYPE to WRIST_JNT to
         execute the trajectory in Cartesian, but interpolate the wrist axes
         in joint. An alternative is to set the tool with a 5 angle, for
         example - -    $TOOL := POS(0, 0, 0, 0, 90, 0, '') - 


37072  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): program counter in multiple line
       statement 

       Cause:
         If the program has been loaded in a normal manner, this is a
         warning message stating that an error has occurred in a multiple
         line statement and that the program counter has been reset to the
         beginning of the statement. If the program continues, some of the
         previous statements will be re-executed. For example: - -   
         CONDITION[1]: -      WHEN HOLD DO -        $FDOUT[rout] := ON -    
         WHEN $FDIN[999] DO -- Invalid $FDIN. -      . . . -    ENDCONDITION
         - After the error, the program counter is reset to the CONDITION
         line and unpausing the program will cause the routine "rout" to be
         called again. - If the program has been loaded in a permanent way
         (ML/P), then this error is severe and means that the program has to
         be deactivated. 

       Remedy:
         If re-execution is a problem, the program should be deactivated and
         re-activated. 


37073  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad arm xtndpos data 

       Cause:
         Access to the current XTNDPOS failed due to either a bad number of
         auxiliary axes ($NUM_AUX_AXES) or due to a bad auxiliary mask
         ($AUX_MASK). 

       Remedy:
         Check that the robot arm has been configured with auxiliary axes. 


37074  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): prog state not passable 

       Cause:
         The BYPASS operation failed as the program state was not passable.
         Certain program states such as READY and DEACTIVATE cannot be
         bypassed. 

       Remedy:
         Check the state of the program and that such a state can be
         bypassed. 


37075  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): 2nd Euler angle less than zero 

       Cause:
         For definition the second Euler angle cannot be less than 0 degrees
         or greater than 180 degrees. 

       Remedy:
         Set the angle accordingly. 


37076  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): local variable error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The routine local variable could not be created. This often occurs
         if the variable is of type XTNDPOS and the robot arm contains no
         auxiliary axes. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the local variables are legal data types. 


37077  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad use of TP0 

       Cause:
         Predefined window device TP0: can only be used in specific
         operations. For example, it cannot be displayed. 

       Remedy:
         Check to be sure the requested operation is legal and that the
         device is not already being used. 


37078  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mismatch in fly $MOVE_TYPE 

       Cause:
         In FLY it is not possible to execute two moves with a mismatch in
         the $MOVE_TYPE when weaving is enabled. For both moves, $MOVE_TYPE
         must be the same or weaving has to be disabled. 

       Remedy:
         Set $MOVE_TYPE to be the same for both moves or disable weaving. 


37079  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mismatch in fly $ORNT_TYPE 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to FLY two moves with a mismatch in the
         $ORNT_TYPE. For both moves, $ORNT_TYPE must be the same. 

       Remedy:
         Set $ORNT_TYPE to be the same for both moves. 


37080  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm already ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ATTACH an arm which has already been
         attached by another program or a MOVE was issued on an arm which
         has been attached by another program. 

       Remedy:
         Determine which program has attached the arm and take the necessary
         action. 


37081  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): motion already ATTACHed arm 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ATTACH an arm which already contains
         motions. 

       Remedy:
         If the ATTACH is necessary, CANCEL ALL motions such that the arm
         does not contain outstanding motions. Then reissue the ATTACH. 


37082  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): prog already ATTACHed arm 

       Cause:
         This program has already attached the arm. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the second ATTACH statement as this is not necessary. 


37083  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm not ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DETACH the arm when it is not ATTACHed. 
         This could happen if the ATTACH action or statement was not
         properly executed. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the ATTACH action or statement has been successfully
         executed. 


37084  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): diff prog ATTACHed arm 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DETACH an arm that is ATTACHed by a
         different program. An arm can be DETACHed only by the program that
         issued the ATTACH. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the DETACH statement or action as it has no effect unless
         this program issued the ATTACH either implicitly or explicitly. 


37085  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no timer resources for WRITE 

       Cause:
         There are a finite number of timer resources. The WRITE statement
         with a timeout failed because the limit has been exceeded. 

       Remedy:
         Either reissue the command or reduce the number of concurrent
         statements that use timers. 


37086  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for WRITE 

       Cause:
         An asynchronous WRITE failed due to insufficient memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory and/or erase something from
         memory. 


37087  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): device not ATTACHable 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ATTACH a device which cannot be attached. 

       Remedy:
         Check the type of device and whether this operation can be
         performed. 


37088  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad turn cnfg flag 

       Cause:
         This can happen in the following cases: the initial turn
         configuration differs from the final one for more than one turn;
         the user sets a turn flag on a joint that cannot do more than 360
         degrees; the joint in the specified movement must do more than 360
         degrees or more than 180 degrees if $TURN_CARE is set to TRUE. 

       Remedy:
         Teach again the same position taking care of the turn
         configuration. Before setting $TURN_CARE to TRUE, please check that
         $JNT_MTURN is not set to FALSE. 


37089  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): aggregate axis not exist 

       Cause:
         A MOVE was specified using an aggregate data to an axis which does
         not exist. For example, this error will occur if the following
         statement were executed for a SMART robot which does not have axis
         7 or 8. - -    MOVE TO {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80} - 

       Remedy:
         Check and correct the MOVE statement. 


37090  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> in pass of WRITE 

       Cause:
         The BYPASS over a WRITE statement failed due to the specified
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


37091  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): screen table full 

       Cause:
         There is a finite number of screens which can be created and
         accessed at the same time. This error reports that the limit has
         been reached. 

       Remedy:
         Check that unused screens have been deleted (SCRN_DEL) and if the
         problem still exists increase the default number of screens
         ($NUM_SCRNS). Increasing the number of screens uses extra memory
         and system resources so it is recommended to delete unused screens
         as opposed to just increasing the number of available screens. 


37092  0-INFO 


37093  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): condition ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         The attempted operation on a condition handler (such as DISABLE,
         PURGE, ENABLE, ATTACH, or redefinition) failed because the
         condition handler has been ATTACHed. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the condition handler number specified is correct.  If
         so, this means that a routine in a different program context run
         from the same program has ATTACHed the condition handler. 


37094  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): string too short 

       Cause:
         The STRING variable passed to a predefined routine is too short for
         holding the device name or node symbol. 

       Remedy:
         For a device name, check that the string length is greater than or
         equal to 5. For a node symbol, verify what name has been set for
         the node and set the string length accordingly. 


37095  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad node index or length 

       Cause:
         The offset or length specified in a path or node predefined routine
         are not valid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the length and offset values are within the path range. 


37096  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): NODE index <index>, limit <max> 

       Cause:
         The NODE[] index of a path is out of range. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the specified index value is correct. 


37097  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $TIMER not ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DETACH a $TIMER element that is not
         currently ATTACHed. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the ATTACH action or statement worked properly. 


37098  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): diff prog ATTACHed $TIMER 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DETACH a $TIMER element that is currently
         ATTACHed by a different program. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the DETACH statement or action since it has no effect unless
         this program issued the ATTACH. 


37099  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): condition not ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DETACH a condition handler that is not
         currently ATTACHed. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the ATTACH action or statement worked properly. 


37100  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): diff prog ATTACHed condition 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DETACH a condition handler that is currently
         ATTACHed by a routine in a different context. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the DETACH statement or action because it has no effect
         unless a routine in the same context issued the ATTACH. 


37101  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for built-in routine 

       Cause:
         Certain built-in routines (eg. NODE_INS) require the use of system
         memory. The routine  failed because no memory resources could be
         found. 

       Remedy:
         Erase unnecessary user program or data from memory. 


37102  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): device not ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DETACH a device which is not currently
         ATTACHed. 

       Remedy:
         Check if the device has been ATTACHed and if not, do not issue the
         DETACH statement or action. 


37103  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): device already ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ATTACH a device which is already ATTACHed by
         this program. 

       Remedy:
         Check the program logic and remove the unnecessary ATTACH
         statement. 


37104  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $SDI element not mapped 

       Cause:
         A $SDI element referenced in a program is currently not mapped. It
         is probably part of a board that is not currently present in the
         system or it is not properly configured. 

       Remedy:
         Check the element index to see if the board is present in the
         system and if it is properly configured. Refer to the
         "System-Defined I/O" appendix for a mapping of $SDI indices. 


37105  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $SDO element not mapped 

       Cause:
         A $SDO element referenced in a program is currently not mapped. It
         is probably part of a board that is not currently present in the
         system or it is not properly configured. 

       Remedy:
         Check the element index, whether or not the board is present in the
         system, and if it is properly configured. Refer to the
         "System-Defined I/O" appendix for a mapping of $SDO indices. 


37106  4-PAUSE %s(%d): elemento $IDIN non mappato

37108  4-PAUSE %s(%d): punto $IDOUT solo leggibile 


37109  4-PAUSE %s(%d): idx $IDIN fuori dominio 


37110  4-PAUSE %s(%d): idx $IDOUT fuori dominio 


37111  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): tool collinear with weave traj 

       Cause:
         The user specified a weaving direction that is collinear to the
         tool orientation. 

       Remedy:
         Change the weaving plane angle or the tool approach on the starting
         point. 


37112  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SIGNAL overflow 

       Cause:
         A SEMAPHORE has overflowed. The maximum number of SIGNALs is 32767. 

       Remedy:
         Check that for every matching SIGNAL there is a matching WAIT. 


37113  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): deleted node accessed 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to access a PATH NODE which has already been
         deleted. 

       Remedy:
         Do not delete the NODE before accessing it. 


37114  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm <arm_num> and node data <data
       arm_num> mismatch 

       Cause:
         The arm specified in the MOVE ALONG statement is different from the
         arm specified in the node declaration. 

       Remedy:
         Either correct the node declaration to match the arm or vice-versa. 


37115  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): node data contains no destination 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to MOVE ALONG a path which contains no $MAIN_
         destination. 

       Remedy:
         The MOVE ALONG can only work on a path if the node declaration
         contains either $MAIN_POS, $MAIN_JNTP, or $MAIN_XTND. 


37116  12-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for MOVE ALONG 

       Cause:
         The MOVE ALONG statement could not be executed because no memory
         resources could be found. 

       Remedy:
         Check the configuration of the memory to see if there is sufficient
         system memory. Erase any unused program code or data. 


37117  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): node <node_num> field not
       initialized 

       Cause:
         The MOVE ALONG statement could not be executed because  either the
         node element's MAIN_xx destination or a node field has not been
         initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Initialize the node element's data ($MAIN_ field or node field). 


37118  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): node <node_num> deleted 

       Cause:
         A node explicitly stated in the MOVE ALONG statement was deleted
         during the execution of the MOVE ALONG.  For example, this error
         would occur if node 10 was deleted during the motion initiated by
         the following statement: - -    MOVE ALONG pth[1..10] - 

       Remedy:
         Do not delete motion nodes which are explicitly referenced in
         statements. 


37119  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): node <node_num> bad circular motion 

       Cause:
         The MOVE ALONG failed as the circular motion was not correctly
         setup. The motion failed because: * ** 1: the last node had a
         termination type of SEG_VIA, ** 2: the termination type was
         CIRCULAR and the preceding node was not SEG_VIA ** 3: a node
         contained the termination type SEG_VIA and the following *     node
         did not contain a termination type of CIRCULAR * 

       Remedy:
         For circular path motion it is necessary to define two nodes. The
         first node must have termination type ($TERM_TYPE) of SEG_VIA and
         the second node a termination type of CIRCULAR.  The data used in
         the motion such as SEG_OVR and condition handler specifications are
         all taken from the second node. 


37120  8-HOLD <prog_id>(<line_num>): error in CONV_TRACK 

       Cause:
         The CONV_TRACK predefined routine has been called with wrong
         parameters. 

       Remedy:
         Please check the values passed to the routine. 


37121  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no COND_TBL element for COND_MASK 

       Cause:
         A bit has been set in the $COND_MASK of a path and the specific
         element in the COND_TBL of the path has not been defined. 

       Remedy:
         A node can contain either $COND_MASK or $COND_MASK_BACK standard
         node field. The bits set in the field are used for referencing the
         condition handlers defined in the condition handler table
         (COND_TBL) of the path. For example, the value of $COND_MASK could
         be 5 ie. bits 1 and 3. Elements 1 and 3 of COND_TBL must contain
         valid condition handler numbers. This error occurs if a bit has
         been set and no condition handler is defined.  Either clear the bit
         in $COND_MASK or define the element in COND_TBL. 


37122  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): FRM_TBL element <element> not
       initialized 

       Cause:
         An uninitialized element of a path's frame table (FRM_TBL) is being
         accessed in the MOVE ALONG. path. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the element has been initialized and that no error has
         occurred on the variable. The built-in VAR_UNINIT can be used for
         checking the state of the variable. 


37123  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad ARM_GET_NODE or ARM_SET_NODE 

       Cause:
         The setting or getting of the node number in the current path via
         the ARM_GET_NODE or ARM_SET_NODE built-ins failed either because no
         path is currently active on the arm or because of an invalid arm
         number has been specified. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the arm number is correct, a path is running, and if
         setting the node, that the node is valid. To check if a path is
         active call ARM_GET_NODE and a value of zero means no path is
         active. 


37124  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> at node <node_num> 

       Cause:
         The error reported happened on the specified node in the specified
         program. 

       Remedy:
         Check the specified error to determine the necessary actions. 


37125  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): err <error_num> at node <node_num> 

       Cause:
         The error reported happened on the specified node. 

       Remedy:
         Check the specified error to determine the necessary actions. 


37126  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): feature not yet implemented 

       Cause:
         The feature is not yet implemented. 

       Remedy:
         Wait for a next software version. 


37127  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no node has such name 

       Cause:
         The PATH_GET_NODE built-in has been called and no node with such a
         name exists. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the name is correct and that a node has been defined and
         not deleted with such a name. 


37128  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): undefined label 

       Cause:
         A GOTO statement could not be executed as there is no such label
         defined. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the GOTO statement or define the label. 


37129  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $SPD_OPT refers to bad aux axis 

       Cause:
         The movement is limited to the velocity of a non-existing auxiliary
         axis. For example, in a robot with a single auxiliary axis, 
         $SPD_OPT cannot be set to SPD_AUX2 or SPD_AUX3 but only to
         SPD_AUX1. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value assigned to $SPD_OPT and verify that the
         corresponding axis exist. 


37130  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $TOOL changed during fly 

       Cause:
         $TOOL cannot be changed during a Cartesian FLY. 

       Remedy:
         Do not execute FLY or do not change $TOOL. 


37131  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): direct kinematic (iterative) not
       available 

       Cause:
         This kind of robot does not support direct kinematics. Direct
         kinematics iterative necessary for SAFE project 

       Remedy:
         Do not use joint positions for Cartesian movements. 


37132  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad JNT_SET_TAR axis or value 

       Cause:
         The axis or value specified in the JNT_SET_TAR built-in is out of
         range or cannot be set. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the axis number and value are valid and that it can be
         set using the built-in. Only certain axis of certain arms can be
         set and the value must be correct relative to the resolver and
         transmission rate. 


37133  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no bytes to WRITE 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to issue an asynchronous WRITE with no
         characters to send. 

       Remedy:
         Do not issue the WRITE of no characters or issue a WRITE with some
         characters. 


37134  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad bit number <bit_num> 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to BIT_SET, BIT_TEST, or BIT_CLEAR a value and
         the bit number specified is not valid. The value must be in the
         range from 1 to 16/32. 

       Remedy:
         Check the built-in call. 


37135  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad state for setting output 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to set an output port (ie. $DOUT, $GOUT or
         $AOUT) when in PROG state and the user is not in direct control of
         the program. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the offending statement so that the program does not issue
         an output; or enter MEMORY DEBUG on the active device or change the
         program configuration. See $PROG_CNFG. The active device is the TP
         if connected and not on the cabinet, otherwise it is the CRT. 


37136  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad DV_CNTRL parameter size 

       Cause:
         One of the parameters passed to the DV_CNTRL built-in is the wrong
         length or size. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the parameters passed to DV_CNTRL are correct. 


37137  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): warning <error_num> in prog 

       Cause:
         A non-EC_PROG or EC_TRAP class of warning occurred in a program.
         This message states the warning and specifies to which program it
         applies. 

       Remedy:
         Review the preceding warning to determine what action should be
         taken. 


37138  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): speed reduced for safety 

       Cause:
         This is a warning message indicating the arm is running at a
         reduced speed because either this is the first motion of the
         activated program or the user interrupted the program execution
         flow in MEMORY DEBUG. 

       Remedy:
         If this feature is not required, set the proper bit in $PROG_CNFG. 


37139  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): $LIN_SPD not obtainable 

       Cause:
         This is a warning message indicating the arm is running at a lower
         speed than $LIN_SPD specified by the user for safety reasons. 


37140  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): trajectory recovery in progress.
       Line:<line_num> 

       Cause:
         This is a warning message indicating the arm is running at a
         reduced speed because of trajectory recovery. 


37141  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): tracking not correctly enabled 

       Cause:
         $SENSOR_TYPE is set to an invalid value. This can happen if
         $SENSOR_TYPE has been set to an unused value or if a weaving frame
         tracking has been requested ($SENSOR_TYPE at value 4, 8, 12)
         without having first activated the weaving on the move. 

       Remedy:
         Verify which sensor is connected to the system and set $SENSOR_TYPE
         accordingly. 


37142  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): tracking enabled without Seam Track 

       Cause:
         Sensor Tracking is enabled but Seam Track is not present. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the presence of Seam Track. 


37143  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): array data type or size mismatch 

       Cause:
         The specified array does not have the correct size or data type. 

       Remedy:
         Check the size and data type requirements for the array variable. 


37144  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): interpolation time too short 

       Cause:
         The interpolation sampling time is too short to execute this
         feature. 

       Remedy:
         Increase the interpolation sampling time using the $IPERIOD system
         variable. 


37145  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis not present for joint weaving 

       Cause:
         The joint weaving has been issued on a axis which does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Check the axis value. 


37146  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): tracking not possible 

       Cause:
         There are different cases in which this error can occur: if a joint
         move has been issued with sensor tracking enabled; if a Cartesian
         move, with the sensor tracking enabled, is joined in fly (or with
         the ADVANCE) to a joint move; if the joint move follows a sensor
         tracking session without movement (enabled via the SENSOR_TRK(ON)
         built-in). 

       Remedy:
         Disable the sensor tracking by setting $SENSOR_ENBL to FALSE before
         running the joint move or remove the fly (or ADVANCE) between the
         Cartesian move and the joint one. 


37147  10-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): previous Sensor Data not
       already read 

       Cause:
         Previous data from the sensor has not been read by the interpolator
         yet. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the rate of the data coming from the sensor and sent to
         the interpolator is not too high with respect to the rate of the
         data being read by the interpolator itself. 


37148  10-DRIVE OFF <prog_id>(<line_num>): sensor Data not jet available 

       Cause:
         The data coming from the sensor is not ready to be read yet. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the rate of writings of the sensor data by the
         interpolator is not too low with respect to the rate of readings of
         the PDL2 program. 


37149  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm mismatch in built-in 

       Cause:
         The built-in execution failed because the arm numbers are the same
         or the arm number of the positioner is lower than the arm number of
         the working arm. 

       Remedy:
         Change the arm numbers in the built-in. 


37150  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): auxiliary axis mismatch in built-in 

       Cause:
         The built-in execution failed because the auxiliary axis were not
         defined or absent. 

       Remedy:
         Define properly the auxiliary axis. 


37151  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $SYNC_ARM not initialized yet 

       Cause:
         The built-in execution failed because the synchronized arm has not
         been defined. 

       Remedy:
         Properly define the synchronized arm. 


37152  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 1 at open stroke end 

       Cause:
         The end position of the issued move has joint 1 at the maximum open
         configuration. 

       Remedy:
         Change the final position. 


37153  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 1 at closed stroke end 

       Cause:
         The end position of the issued move has joint 1 at the maximum
         close configuration. 

       Remedy:
         Change the final position. 


37154  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 2 at open stroke end 

       Cause:
         The end position of the issued move has joint 2 at the maximum open
         configuration. 

       Remedy:
         Change the final position. 


37155  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 2 at closed stroke end 

       Cause:
         The end position of the issued move has joint 2 at the maximum
         close configuration. 

       Remedy:
         Change the final position.

37157  0-INFO 


37158  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): mismatch in fly $WEAVE_TYPE 

       Cause:
         The value of $WEAVE_TYPE is different between two Cartesian
         movements in fly. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the fly between the two movements or put the same value of
         $WEAVE_TYPE. 


37159  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): SENSOR_TRK already enabled 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a SENSOR_TRK(ON) is issued twice. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the second call to SENSOR_TRK built-in as this is not
         necessary. 


37160  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SENSOR_TRK already reserved 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when attempting to issue the SENSOR_TRK built-in
         by a holdable program different from the one that has already
         enabled SENSOR_TRK on the same arm. SENSOR_TRK(OFF) can be only
         issued by the program that previously performed with success the
         SENSOR_TRK(ON) built-in. 

       Remedy:
         Try to use the SENSOR_TRK built-in within a single holdable
         program. If multiple holdable programs use the SENSOR_TRK built-in,
         organize the statement execution so that a SENSOR_TRK(ON) is issued
         only when SENSOR_TRK is OFF. 


37161  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): holdable built-in in nohold prog 

       Cause:
         A NOHOLD program cannot interpret HOLDable built-ins, such as
         SENSOR_TRK. 

       Remedy:
         Change the program attribute. 


37162  0-INFO 


37163  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): frame changed 

       Cause:
         $UFRAME is changed during a Cartesian FLY movement when $TOOL_RMT
         is set to TRUE or $BASE, $TOOL, $UFRAME or $SFRAME are changed
         between two movements in fly (or ADVANCE) with the absolute
         modality of Sensor Tracking enabled ($SENSOR_ENBL=TRUE and
         $SENSOR_TYPE=9, 10, 11 or 12). 

       Remedy:
         Avoid changing the frame during fly or between two movements having
         the ADVANCE clause. Remove fly (or ADVANCE) if possible. 


37164  0-INFO 


37165  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $SENSOR_TYPE change not possible 

       Cause:
         This $SENSOR_TYPE modification is not allowed, unless the sensor
         tracking session is interrupted. 

       Remedy:
         Interrupt the sensor tracking session. Note that a sensor tracking
         session is considered interrupted if neither fly nor ADVANCE is
         present between two movements and SENSOR_TRK is OFF. 


37166  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): joint trajectory not allowed 

       Cause:
         Cannot use joint trajectory when Cartesian tracking is enabled or
         in the first move after the disabling (move of uncoupling). 

       Remedy:
         Use a linear trajectory instead of a joint one for these
         situations. 


37167  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ADVANCE not allowed 

       Cause:
         Conveyor tracking has been enabled/disabled during an ADVANCE.
         Cannot change $CONV_TYPE when a move is active. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the ADVANCE from the previous move statement. 


37168  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): position out of work zone 

       Cause:
         The Cartesian or joint position is not in the correct zone of work. 

       Remedy:
         Change the position. 


37169  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): condition rate out of range 

       Cause:
         The condition rate specified in the statement is negative or too
         large. 

       Remedy:
         Change the statement to a value that is in range. 


37170  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): SCAN with no states 

       Cause:
         This warning occurs when the SCAN attribute is specified but the
         condition has no states defined. In this case the SCAN attribute
         will be ignored. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the SCAN attribute from the CONDITION. 


37171  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad data type for VAR_UNINIT 

       Cause:
         The VAR_UNINIT built-in does not accept records, semaphores, nodes
         or any type of array. 

       Remedy:
         Do not use those data types with the VAR_UNINIT built-in. 


37172  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): DISABLE/ENABLE INTERRUPT mismatch 

       Cause:
         The ENABLE/DISABLE Interrupt statements do not match. Either an
         attempt to enable interrupts has been made while the interrupts are
         already enabled or to an attempt to disable interrupts has been
         made while the interrupts are already disabled. 

       Remedy:
         Check that each enable interrupt matches with a disable interrupt.
         Do not forget that the RETURN instruction itself does an automatic
         ENABLE interrupt. 


37173  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): cnfg changed before recovery 

       Cause:
         A recovery trajectory in a Cartesian modality ($RCVR_TYPE) has been
         required but it is not possible because some positional
         configuration flags changed when jogging the robot away from the
         stopped position. 

       Remedy:
         Set $RCVR_TYPE to a joint modality for recovery (values 0, 1, or 2)
         and restart the movement. Then restore the original value. 


37174  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): START/BACK not allowed 

       Cause:
         The START/BACK keys are currently disabled. This occurs after some
         errors or when a manual motion is executed outside a programming
         environment (IDE, MD, EXECUTE,..) and not in PROG. 

       Remedy:
         If the keys are disabled due to an error, clear the error. 
         Otherwise, from PROGR, enter the programming environment.

37180  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $TERM_TYPE value not allowed 

       Cause:
         During conveyor tracking no check is allowed on the tollerance on
         final points. Hence $TERM_TYPE system variable must be set to
         NOSETTLE. This is due to the continuous motion of the robot during
         the conveyor tracking. 

       Remedy:
         Set $TERM_TYPE to the NOSETTLE value during conveyor tracking and
         restore the original value when conveyor tracking is disabled. 


37181  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $BASE or $TOOL changed finishing
       tracking 

       Cause:
         During the last move before loosing the conveyor tracking it is
         only allowed to change $UFRAME and not $BASE or $TOOL frames. This
         move is the first movement executed after a conveyor tracking
         phase. 

       Remedy:
         Avoide changing $BASE and $TOOL when loosing the conveyor tracking. 


37182  0-INFO 


37183  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $RCVR_TYPE value not allowed 

       Cause:
         During conveyor tracking it is not allowed to recovery the
         trajectory using a joint trajectory. Hence $RCVR_TYPE system
         variable should be choosen for selecting a Cartesian trajectory.
         This is due to the continuous motion of the robot during the
         conveyor tracking. 

       Remedy:
         Set $RCVR_TYPE in order to use a Cartesian trajectory for the
         recovery of the move. 


37184  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $CONV_WIN[1] unreachable 

       Cause:
         Conveyor tracking is probably held. Using the current value of
         $CONV_ZERO it it not possible to enter in the zone defined by
         $CONV_WIN[1] and $CONV_WIN[2]. This situation can easily happen in
         PROG state without having updated the value of $CONV_ZERO. 

       Remedy:
         Update the value of $CONV_ZERO with the current value of
         $CONV_TBL[n].CT_RES. 


37185  0-INFO 


37186  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): forbidded motion for integrated arm 

       Cause:
         The first arm of a couple of integrated arms (the carrier) moved in
         a non syncronized way while the second arm was executing a
         linear/circular movement on a JOINTPOS or a JOINT movement on a
         POSITION/XTNDPOS. 

       Remedy:
         Move the two arms with a SYNCMOVE statement or try to maintain
         steady the first arm while executing this particular type of motion
         with the second. Note that the first arm is allowed to move while
         the second arm is doing LINEAR/CIRCULAR movements on a
         POSITION/XTNDPOS or JOINT movements on a JOINTPOS. 


37187  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SENSOR_TRK not attached 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when attempting to issue the SENSOR_SET_OFST
         built-in by a holdable program while the SENSOR has not yet been
         attached by any program. 

       Remedy:
         Use the SENSOR_TRK built-in within an holdable program to attach
         the SENSOR. 


37188  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): forbidded motion on AUX axes 

       Cause:
         The external auxiliary axes have been disabled via the execution of
         the built-in. A movement on those axes has been requested, but it
         is not possible to execute it as these axes are disabled. 

       Remedy:
         Do not try to move external auxiliary axes while they are disabled.
         For moving them, execute the built-in for enabling them. 


37189  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad AUX_SET axis 

       Cause:
         The axis specified in the AUX_SET built-in cannot be set as it does
         not exist or it is not configured for this feature. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the axis number is valid and that it can be set using
         the built-in. Only certain axis of certain arms can be set due to
         the configuration file. 


37190  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): $RCVR_DIST not completely
       satisfied 

       Cause:
         This is a warning message indicating the arm is performing a
         trajectory recovery in the modality of Process resume
         ($RCVR_TYPE=9) but the $RCVR_DIST value can not be completely
         satisfied because of one of the following reasons: - the $RCVR_DIST
         could be grater than the distance from the initial position of the
         current move; - if there was a fly at the beginning of the
         interrupted move, the $RCVR_DIST could be greater than the distance
         from the end of the fly; - there was a fly active. The interrupted
         move will be recovered starting from a position closer to the
         interrupted point than the programmed distance ($RCVR_DIST). 

       Remedy:
         It is a warning, so the recovery move will be performed anyway. 


37191  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): process resume trajectory in
       progress 

       Cause:
         This is a warning message indicating the arm is performing a
         trajectory recovery in the modality of Process resume
         ($RCVR_DIST>0). The arm is running at a reduced speed because of
         trajectory recovery. 


37192  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm needs Calibration operation 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to execute MOVE instructions when the arm is not
         calibrated. 

       Remedy:
         Calibrate the arm before executing MOVE instructions. 


37193  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm needs Turn Set operation 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to execute MOVE instructions when the arm needs
         the turn-set operation. 

       Remedy:
         Turn-set the arm before executing MOVE instructions. 


37194  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): move(s) in progress 

       Cause:
         If a STANDBY built-in has been executed, it is not possible to
         enter in the STANDBY state as there are one or more moves in
         progress. If a AUX_SET built-in has been executed, it is not
         possible to connect/disconnect an axis as there are one or more
         moves in progress. 

       Remedy:
         Use the STANDBY built-in or the AUXSET built-in to enter in the
         STANDBY state when there are no moves in progress. 


37195  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): STANDBY state not available 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to enter in the STANDBY state as the system may
         not be in the AUTO (local or remote) state or the STANDBY feature
         is disabled. 

       Remedy:
         Use the STANDBY built-in when the system is in AUTO state. Check
         that the STANDBY feature is enabled; $TUNE[27] is not equal zero. 


37196  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): auxiliary axis already reserved 

       Cause:
         This error occurs if another program has already reserved the
         auxiliary axis management (by calling the AUX_SET/AUX_DRIVES
         built-in before this program) and that program is still active at
         the moment. 

       Remedy:
         Check that no other active programs have executed the
         AUX_SET/AUX_DRIVES built-in on the same arm. 


37197  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): BYPASS of SYS_CALL/DV_CNTRL 

       Cause:
         A SYS_CALL or DV_CNTRL has been bypassed due to BYPASS statement or
         command, in most of the cases issued by a different program. The
         trapping on of this error causes the execution of this program to
         continue. 

       Remedy:
         As the SYS_CALL/DV_CNTRL statement can be interrupted, the PDL2
         program should be structured to foresee this case. For example
         testing the $SYS_CALL_STS  or $DV_STS. 


37198  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad mask value 

       Cause:
         The value specified with the statement/built-in, does not fits in
         the foreseen range. For example, in case of BYPASS statement, the
         integer mask parameter must correspond to the number associated to
         a specific suspendable statement to be bypassed. In case of
         ON_JNT_SET statement, the axes mask must be the same of $JNT_MASK
         or a subset of it. 

       Remedy:
         Check which is the correct mask value for the statement/built-in. 


37199  8-HOLD <prog_id>(<line_num>): kinematic compensation out of
       tolerance 

       Cause:
         The error occurs in case of kinematic compensation alghorithm
         enabled,  if the correction that has been introduced is greater
         than the specified tolerance. Usually this happens if the position
         specified in the motion statement is located near a singularity
         point. 

       Remedy:
         Change the destination of the motion statement. If the error still
         occurs, please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


37200  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): parameters data type conflict 

       Cause:
         The parameters specified in the routine should be of the same data
         type. 

       Remedy:
         Pass parameters of the same data type to the routine. 


37201  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): gun axis not calibrated 

       Cause:
         The axis of the gun is not calibrated and this causes the operation
         failure. 

       Remedy:
         Calibrate the axis using the SPOT application program and execute
         the operation again. 


37202  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): gun axis to be calibrated 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to execute MOVE statements is the gun axis is
         not calibrated. 

       Remedy:
         Calibrate the axis using the SPOT application program before
         issuing motion statements again. 


37203  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): posture not compensable 

       Cause:
         The Joint or Cartesian position cannot be compesated with the
         compensation algorithm. The Joints could be near the stroke ends
         (indluding open or closed parallelogram stroke end). 

       Remedy:
         Modify the Joint or Cartesian position moving the axes that are
         near stroke end limitations. 


37204  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): Position in singularity of
       compensation 

       Cause:
         The Joint or Cartesian position cannot be compesated with the
         compensation algorithm: axis 5 is in singularity. 

       Remedy:
         Modify the Joint or Cartesian position moving the axis 5 out of the
         singularity area. 


37205  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): Cartesian Position not compensable 

       Cause:
         In case of compensation algorithm active, it means that the
         programmed Joint or Cartesian position cannot be compensated. 

       Remedy:
         In case of compensation algorithm active, program the Joint or
         Cartesian position out of the area where the compensation cannot
         work. 


37206  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $FLOW_TBL already reserved 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a program issues the FLOW_MOD_ON or the
         FLOW_MOD_OFF on an element of the $FLOW_TBL that is already
         reserved to a different program. 

       Remedy:
         It is a good programming rule to call the FLOW_MOD_ON, for enabling
         the modulation alghorithm, and the FLOW_MOD_OFF, for disabling it,
         always from the same program. 


37207  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): wrong value in Flow Modulate 

       Cause:
         A parameter to the FLOW_MOD_ON / FLOW_MOD_OFF built-in  or a value
         in the $FLOW_TBL table is not correctly set.  For example, the
         index of the analogic port passed as parameter to the FLOW_MOD_ON /
         FLOW_MOD_OFF is not correct; or the arm number in $FW_ARM is not an
         arm defined in the system. 

       Remedy:
         Change the wrong value in $FLOW_TBL or the parameter passed to
         FLOW_MOD_ON / FLOW_MOD_OFF routine and issue the statement again. 


37208  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis not present 

       Cause:
         The specified axis is not present. This error can also occur after
         calling the FLOW_MOD_ON built-in when the axis defined in the
         $FLOW_TBL[].FW_AXIS field does not exists for the arm specified in
         $FLOW_TBL[].FW_ARM. 

       Remedy:
         Check the axis validity. In case of FLOW_MOD_ON, properly check the
         FW_AXIS field  (and eventually FW_ARM) in the $FLOW_TBL. 


37209  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): wrong table index 

       Cause:
         The specified table index does not exist. 

       Remedy:
         Issue the statement specifying a correct table index. 


37210  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): analogic port required 

       Cause:
         The statement requires the definition of an analogic port (for
         example $WORD). 

       Remedy:
         Change the program in order to define the port to be used. In case
         of FLOW_MOD_ON, pass the port as parameter. In case of ON_POS, the
         port must already have been defined via the ON_POS_SET / ON_JNT_SET
         call  that should preceede the ON_POS call. 


37211  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $ON_POS_TBL already reserved 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a program issues the ON_POS_SET on an
         already reserved element. 

       Remedy:
         Call the ON_POS(OFF) before the ON_POS_SET. 


37212  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad value in $ON_POS_TBL 

       Cause:
         A value in the $ON_POS_TBL is not properly set. For example, the
         $OP_TOOL_DSBL field cannot be TRUE if $OP_TOOL_RMT has a value of
         TRUE. 

       Remedy:
         Check values compatibility in the $ON_POS_TBL fields settings. 


37213  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): arm <arm_num> in rout and <arm_num>
       in JOINTPOS conflict 

       Cause:
         The arm specified as parameter to the internal routine ON_POS is
         different than the arm related to the JOINTPOS variable passed as
         parameter to the ON_JNT_SET. 

       Remedy:
         Uniform the arms, by changing the arm passed to the ON_POS routine
         or redefining the jointpos associated to the table.

37215  0-INFO 


37216  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis non yet configured 

       Cause:
         This error occurs upon the execution of an operation that needs the
         information related to all axes, included the auxiliary ones (for
         example in case of teaching of points via REC key). 

       Remedy:
         Use the tool for the configuration of auxiliary axes (FAMILY). 


37217  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): Bad parameter to SYS_SETUP 

       Cause:
         The parameters passed to SYS_SETUP are invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Verify that the correct number of axes and auxillary axes have been
         specified. 


37218  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $OUT part of group 

       Cause:
         A $OUT element cannot be referenced because the element itself is
         part of a $GOUT. 

       Remedy:
         Refer the element using the $GOUT or change the definition of the
         output group. 


37219  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $IN is part of a group 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to refer a $IN element because the element
         itself is part of a $GIN. 

       Remedy:
         Refer the element using the $IN or change the definition of the
         input group. 


37220  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): stroke end axis 9+

       Remedy:
         Check that the index number is valid and that the servo board does
         exist. 


37226  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no timer resource for WAIT FOR 

       Cause:
         The number of timer resources is limited. The WAIT FOR statement
         could not be executed due to limits overflow. 

       Remedy:
         Re-issue the command or reduce the number of concurrent statements
         that use timers. 


37227  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $AIN is read-only 

       Cause:

       Cause:
         The extension of the file name is unknow. 

       Remedy:
         Please check the extension of the file name. It should be 'EDS' or
         'GSD'. Verify also that the file exists. 


37235  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): FB_DATA_SHEET not declared protocol 

       Cause:
         The referenced FBP_TBL does not support the protocol specified. For
         example, an attempt is made to read a file with extension '.GSD',
         related to PROFIBUS, but the FBP_TBL referenced by the built-in
         call referenced another protocol. 

       Remedy:
         There must be a match beetwen the protocol type declared in the
         $FBP_TBL for a certain FBP board and the extension of the file name
         in the FB_DATA_SHEET() call. 


37236  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): FB_DATA_SHEET index out of range

37268  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): Joint-Cartesian Fly in conflict with
       SmartMove 

       Cause:
         If the SmartMove feature is present, it is not possible to execute
         two FLY motions with different settings in the $MOVE_TYPE. This
         variable must be set in the same way in both motions. 

       Remedy:
         Assign the same value to $MOVE_TYPE in both movements or disable
         the SmartMove Cartesian feature. 


37269  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): Missing/too many MV targets 

       Cause:

         switching off of the controller is required. 

       Remedy:
         Contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


37900  0-INFO Unable to synchronize clocks, error <error> 

       Cause:
         The system failed to synchronise clocks on different boards 

       Remedy:
         Check the error code. 


37901  0-INFO Unable to contact DNS server 

       Cause:
         At startup unable to contact the DNS server. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the DNS configuration and server exists. 


37902  0-INFO Minimum configuration due to abort button 

       Cause:
         The system has started in minimal configuration due to the abort
         button being pressed. 

       Remedy:
         Pressing the ABORT button during the startup procedure can be used
         for bypassing certain startup actions and thereby starting in a
         "safe mode". To come out of the safe mode restart without the Abort
         button. 


37903  0-INFO I/O configuration loaded from <file_name> 

       Cause:
         This is an informational message. 


37904  4-PAUSE NVRAM not consistent 

       Cause:
         This is an informational message. 

       Remedy:
         This is a simple informational message. 


37905  10-DRIVE OFF Arm <num_arm> iterative inverse kinematics not
       available 

       Cause:
         This machine does not have the iterative inverse kinematics. 

       Remedy:
         Contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


37906  4-PAUSE Controller Ip address not assigned 

       Cause:
         The ip address of the controller was not correctly assigned to the
         main ethernet interface. 

       Remedy:
         This problem is often caused by a conflict between two ip addresses
         on the network. Check if another device has the same ip address
         assigned to the controller. 


37907  10-DRIVE OFF Loading error of the ITDM params for arm %d 

       Cause:
         There is an error during the loading of the ITDM model 

       Remedy:
         Contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com).

39937  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ACOS value range (-1 to 1) 

       Cause:
         The value passed to the ACOS built-in is invalid. The value must be
         in the range 1.0 to -1.0. The result returned when this error is 
         trapped on is an uninitialized REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value passed to the built-in. 


39938  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ARRAY_DIM one dim array 

       Cause:
         The argument to the ARRAY_DIM2 built-in is invalid as it is only a
         one dimensional array. The result returned when this error is
         trapped on is an uninitialized INTEGER. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value passed to the built-in. 


39939  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ASIN value range (-1 to 1) 

       Cause:
         The value passed to the ASIN built-in is invalid. The value must be
         in the range 1.0 to -1.0. The result returned when this error is
         trapped on is an uninitialized REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39940  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ATAN2 value both zero 

       Cause:
         The values passed to the ATAN2 built-in are both equal to zero. The
         result returned when this error is trapped on is an uninitialized
         REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value passed to the built-in. 


39941  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): CHR bad index 

       Cause:
         The index to the CHR built-in is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the index is within the string length. 


39942  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $IR_TBL already reserved 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when a program issues an IR_SWITCH(ON) on an
         already reserved element of the $IR_TBL; or the element is declared
         as "PERMANENT". 

       Remedy:
         Call IR_SWITCH(OFF) before issuing the IR_SET. 


39943  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ERR_POST bad severity or number 

       Cause:
         The error number or severity or both are invalid in the ERR_POST
         built-in. Valid error numbers are in the range 43008 to 44031.
         Valid severity numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameters to the built-in. 


39944  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): EXP value out of range 

       Cause:
         The value passed to the EXP built-in is invalid. The value must be
         less than 88.7. The result returned when this error is trapped on
         is an uninitialized REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39945  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): HDIN_READ position not read 

       Cause:
         The HDIN_READ built-in failed as the arm data has not been read. 

       Remedy:
         Either the HDIN did not trigger or the HDIN_SET was not set up to
         record the arm position. 


39946  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): HDIN_SET bad lock arm 

       Cause:
         The lock arms specified as the parameters to the HDIN_SET built-in
         are not present. 

       Remedy:
         HDIN_SET can only lock arms which are defined in the mask of the
         predefined variable $REF_ARMS. 


39947  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): JNTP_TO_POS jntp not initialized 

       Cause:
         The JNTP_TO_POS built-in failed because the JOINTPOS data has not
         been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value passed to the built-in. 


39948  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): LN value <= zero 

       Cause:
         The value passed to the LN built-in is invalid. The value must be
         greater than 0.0. The result returned when this error is trapped on
         is an uninitialized REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39949  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ORD bad index 

       Cause:
         The index passed to the ORD built-in is invalid. The value must be
         greater than 0 and less than or equal to the current length of the
         STRING variable. The result returned when this error is trapped on
         is an uninitialized INTEGER. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39950  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): POS_FRAME pos parallel 

       Cause:
         The positional values passed to the FRAME built-in are co-linear
         and therefore the frame position cannot be calculated. The result
         returned when this error is trapped on is an uninitialized
         POSITION. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39951  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): POS_TO_JNTP pos not initialized 

       Cause:
         The POS_TO_JNTP built-in failed due to the fact that the Cartesian
         positional data has not been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value passed to the built-in. 


39952  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SCRN_GET unknown screen 

       Cause:
         The SCRN_GET built-in failed to find the current screen on the
         particular device. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the PDV_TP or PDV_CRT physical device has been passed to
         the built-in. 


39953  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SQRT value less than zero 

       Cause:
         The value passed to the SQRT built-in is invalid. The value must be
         greater than or equal to 0.0. The result returned when this error
         is trapped on is an uninitialized REAL. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39954  2-WARNING <id_prog>(<num_linea>): Continuous statement limit
       reached 

       Cause:
         The limit on number of continuous statements without any
         asynchronous statement has been reached. This effects CPU usage and
         performance so please check what has been written in the PDL2
         program and wherever possible use events and asynchronous
         statements. 

       Remedy:
         Check the program statements and if necessary add a DELAY. 


39955  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): STR_DEL bad start or length 

       Cause:
         Either the STRING has no length or the starting index or the length
         specified in the STR_DEL built-in is invalid. Index and length
         values must be greater than or equal to one. If the error is
         trapped on, the STRING remains unchanged. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39956  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): STR_INS bad index 

       Cause:
         The starting index to the STR_INS built-in is invalid. The value
         must be greater than zero and less than the current string length
         or, if the STRING is uninitialized, the index must be zero. The
         destination STRING must be of a valid length. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39957  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): STR_LOC bad string 

       Cause:
         Either the given STRING or the find STRING passed to the STR_LOC
         built-in has no value. The result returned if the error is trapped
         on is 0. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39958  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): STR_OVS bad index 

       Cause:
         The source STRING passed to the STR_OVS built-in is not initialized
         or the index is incorrect or the destination STRING is of zero
         length. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter passed to the built-in. 


39959  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): STR_XTRT bad index 

       Cause:
         One of the parameters to the STR_XTRT built-in is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the starting index is greater than 0 and less than the
         length of the source STRING and that the length to be extracted is
         greater than zero. Trapping on this error sets the target STRING to
         an uninitialized STRING value. 


39960  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SYS_CALL error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The SYS_CALL built-in failed due to the specified error. Trapping
         on this error causes execution of the program to continue. The
         program predefined variable $SYS_CALL_STS is set to the specified
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


39961  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): offset greater than string length 

       Cause:
         The offset specified on the STRING predefined variable in the
         built-in is invalid. The offset must be greater than zero and less
         than the current length or, if the STRING is uninitialized, the
         offset must be zero. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the offset parameter. 


39962  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ofst not on field boundary 

       Cause:
         The offset specified on the predefined variable is invalid. The
         offset must be on an element boundary and within the memory of the
         variable. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the offset parameter. 


39963  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): limits on system variable 

       Cause:
         The predefined variable specified in the built-in can contain only
         a limited range of values and an offset, conversion, or length have
         been specified in the built-in. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify either the offset, conversion, or length parameter
         if the predefined variable is to be accessed or use direct access. 


39964  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad conversion specified 

       Cause:
         The conversion factor specified in the built-in is invalid. The
         conversion can only be for bytes and words and the destination must
         be less than 4 bytes. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the conversion parameter. 


39965  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): specification length too long 

       Cause:
         The length specified in the built-in is invalid. The length + the
         offset must be within the boundary of the source and destination
         variable. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the offset or length parameters supplied to the
         built-in. 


39966  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): specification offset too long 

       Cause:
         The offset specified for the predefined variable in the built-in is
         invalid. The offset must be greater than zero and within the
         boundary of the source and destination variable. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the offset or length parameters supplied to the
         built-in. 


39967  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): length not a multiple of element
       size 

       Cause:
         The length specified or calculated for an ARRAY predefined variable
         in the built-in is invalid. For ARRAYs, the length must be a
         multiple of the element size. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the offset or length parameter for the ARRAY
         predefined variable. 


39968  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): specification offset not on element
       boundary 

       Cause:
         The offset specified or calculated for an ARRAY predefined variable
         in the built-in is invalid. For ARRAYs, the offset must be on an
         ARRAY element boundary. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the offset or length parameter for the ARRAY
         predefined variable. 


39969  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): VOL_SPACE label string too short 

       Cause:
         The length of the STRING passed to the VOL_SPACE built-in is too
         short. The string length must be at least 12. 

       Remedy:
         Pass a STRING whose length is greater than 11. 


39970  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WIN_CLEAR bad option 

       Cause:
         The clear specification parameter passed to the WIN_CLEAR built-in
         is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the parameter is one of the WIN_CLR_xxx predefined
         constants. 


39971  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WIN_CREATE/WIN_SIZE bad number of
       rows 

       Cause:
         The number of rows specified in the WIN_CREATE or WIN_SIZE built-in
         is invalid. The value must be greater than zero and less than the
         number of rows on the particular device. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the number of rows parameter. 


39972  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad physical device 

       Cause:
         The physical device specified in one of the WIN_CREATE, SCRN_SET,
         SCRN_FONT, or SCRN_CLEAR built-ins is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the parameter such that it is one of the PDV_xxx
         predefined constants. 


39973  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WIN_DEL window not deleted 

       Cause:
         The WIN_DEL built-in failed because either files are currently open
         on the device or the device is currently being displayed. 

       Remedy:
         Check the state of the window by using WIN_STATE and either close
         the files or remove the window or both. 


39974  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WIN_REMOVE window not displayed 

       Cause:
         The WIN_REMOVE built-in failed because the window is currently not
         being displayed. 

       Remedy:
         Check the state of the window by using WIN_STATE and take the
         corrective action. 


39975  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WIN_REMOVE POP-UPs on window 

       Cause:
         The WIN_REMOVE built-in failed because either the fixed window
         contains pop-up windows or the TP0: window is not being displayed. 

       Remedy:
         Check the state of the window by using WIN_STATE and remove the
         offending pop-up windows before trying to remove the fixed window. 


39976  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): EXIT CYCLE program not in a cycle 

       Cause:
         The EXIT CYCLE statement failed because the program has not yet
         entered the CYCLE .. END loop. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the current program counter position is within the CYCLE
         and END of the program and that the CYCLE statement or attribute is
         included in the program. 


39977  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no matching CASE 

       Cause:
         No matching CASE could be found in the SELECT statement. 

       Remedy:
         Check the select value and the list of CASEs. If necessary add the
         ELSE: clause for handling the unexpected select value. 


39978  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): PULSE time < 0 

       Cause:
         The time specified with the PULSE statement is less than zero. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the pulse time. 


39979  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): DELAY time less than 0 or greater
       than a week 

       Cause:
         The time specified in the DELAY statement is less than zero or
         greater than the maximum allowed value. 

       Remedy:
         Change the time value specified in the DELAY statement. 


39980  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no memory for activation 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ACTIVATE a program but there are
         insufficient memory resources. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the size of the program stack is not too large. Erase
         unneeded code and/or data from memory. 


39981  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program not loaded 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ACTIVATE a program which is currently not
         loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Load the program into memory before trying to activate it. 


39982  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program already active 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ACTIVATE a program which is already active. 

       Remedy:
         Either DEACTIVATE the program and then reissue the ACTIVATE or
         leave as is. 


39983  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program being edited 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ACTIVATE the program currently being edited
         in PROGRAM EDIT/DATA or viewed in MEMORY DEBUG. Only the editor can
         activate this program. 

       Remedy:
         ACTIVATE the program from within the editor by issuing the RUN
         command. 


39984  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program not loaded 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to DEACTIVATE a program which is not only not
         active, it is not even loaded in memory. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the program name specified in the DEACTIVATE statement
         is correct. 


39985  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program not active 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to either DEACTIVATE or EXIT CYCLE a program
         which is currently not active. 

       Remedy:
         Check the state of the program and determine what action to take. 


39986  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program not active 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to change the state and unsuspend a program
         which is currently not active. This typically occurs when trying to
         UNPAUSE or PAUSE a program which is not yet active. 

       Remedy:
         Check what the program state should be. 


39987  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program already unsuspended 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to change the state and suspend a program which
         is currently not active. This typically occurs when trying to
         UNPAUSE or PAUSE a program which is not yet active. 

       Remedy:
         Check what the program state should be. 


39988  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): program already suspended 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to change the state and suspend a program which
         is already suspended for the same reason. This typically occurs
         when trying to PAUSE a program which is already paused. 

       Remedy:
         Check what the program state should be. 


39989  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): division by zero 

       Cause:
         A division by zero was attempted. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the right hand side of the division operator. 


39990  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): READ/Filer error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The specified error occurred during a READ or FILER operation. Due
         to the fact that many errors can be reported for FILER and READ
         operations, this message is used so that the errors can be trapped.
         The predefined variable $FL_STS contains the specified error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


39991  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): READ has been canceled 

       Cause:
         A READ operation has been canceled. This is normally due to the
         fact that the program which issued the READ has been deactivated.
         If there are pending READs the data read may be inconsistent. 

       Remedy:
         This is only a warning. No action is necessary. 


39992  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): READ timeout 

       Cause:
         The READ operation has timed out. The program predefined variable
         $READ_TOUT can be used for specifying for how long the program
         should wait for the READ. When the READ times out, the unread
         variables are set uninitialized. 

       Remedy:
         Either reissue the READ or continue with the variables set to an
         uninitialized value. 


39993  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): file closed on READ 

       Cause:
         The READ operation has been aborted because the LUN has been
         closed. 

       Remedy:
         Cancel the READ operation before attempting to close the file if
         this is a problem. 


39994  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad BOOLEAN READ 

       Cause:
         The data read for a BOOLEAN variable is invalid. The valid values
         are TRUE, FALSE, ON, and OFF and any unique substring such as TR or
         F. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the data is a legal value. 


39995  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad formatted READ data 

       Cause:
         The data read was not valid for the type of variable. For example,
         if an INTEGER variable is being read, this error will occur if the
         data contains nonnumeric characters. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the data supplied to the READ matches the data type of
         the variable. 


39996  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): READ EOF 

       Cause:
         During the READ operation the end of file (EOF) was detected and
         therefore the data was incompletely read. 

       Remedy:
         Check for the end of file condition before issuing the READ. This
         can be done using the EOF built-in. 


39997  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): trap <error_num> already exists 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ERR_TRAP_ON an error which is already
         trapped on. 

       Remedy:
         Do not reissue the ERR_TRAP_ON for the same error number. 


39998  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): trap <error_par> does not exist 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to ERR_TRAP_OFF an error which is currently not
         trapped on. 

       Remedy:
         Do not issue the ERR_TRAP_OFF for an error which is not trapped on. 


39999  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad trap numbad trap number 

       Cause:
         The value passed to ERR_TRAP_ON or ERR_TRAP_OFF is invalid. The
         number must be a valid EC_TRAP class error which are in the range
         39936 to 40959. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the error number value. 


40000  0-INFO %s(%d): %s 


40001  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad program priority 

       Cause:
         The program PRIORITY attribute is invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the program PRIORITY attribute has a value of 1, 2, or
         3. 


40002  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): error statement 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made in edit to execute an ~ERROR~ statement. 

       Remedy:
         Either correct the statement such that it is no longer an error or
         place the cursor on the next line and continue execution. 


40003  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): held as step cycle 

       Cause:
         A single CYCLE has been executed and the step mode is CYCLE. 

       Remedy:
         The program is suspended in the ready state. To continue the
         execution, press the START button or for NOHOLDable programs the
         RUN key can be pressed. 


40004  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): held as step move (fly) 

       Cause:
         A single MOVE has been executed and the step mode is MOVE. 

       Remedy:
         The program is suspended in the ready state. To continue the
         execution, press the START button. 


40005  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): magnitude of vector is zero 

       Cause:
         The magnitude of the VECTOR calculated in one of the POS_FRAME,
         POS_SET_APPR, POS_SET_ORNT, or POS_SET_NORM built-ins is zero. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value passed to the built-in. 


40006  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): ENCODE string or buffer full 

       Cause:
         The STRING in which data is being ENCODEd or the buffer used for
         the asynchronous WRITE is full. 

       Remedy:
         Reduce the amount of data being written or encoded or increase the
         size of the ENCODE STRING. 


40007  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad BY clause in event 

       Cause:
         The BY clause specified with one of the ERRORNUM or ERRORCLASS
         error events is not permitted. The BY clause cannot be used if the
         error is not in the EC_TRAP or EC_PROG class of errors. This error
         also occurs in WHEN EVENT condition expressions when the event
         number is not a user event and the BY clause is specified. 

       Remedy:
         If the BY clause is associated with an error event, check that the
         error number specified in the error event is correct. If the BY
         clause is associated with an EVENT event (WHEN EVENT), check that
         the event number stays in the range from 49152 to 50175. 


40008  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): unknown screen in window built-in 

       Cause:
         The screen specified in one of the SCRN_SET, SCRN_FONT, or
         SCRN_CLEAR built-ins is invalid. The valid screens are SCRN_USER,
         SCRN_SYS, or SCRN_EDIT. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value passed to the built-in. 


40009  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): window error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         During a window operation the specified error occurred. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


40010  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $BASE not initialized 

       Cause:
         The value of $BASE is not initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value of $BASE. 


40011  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $TOOL not initialized 

       Cause:
         The value of $TOOL is not initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value of $TOOL. 


40012  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): pos out of range 

       Cause:
         The Cartesian position is out of the available workspace for this
         arm. 

       Remedy:
         It is necessary to change the position so that it is within the arm
         workspace. 


40013  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 1 at undefined pos 

       Cause:
         The arm, typically a SMART robot, has the center of the wrist align
         with the z-axis of the world frame. This is an arm singularity. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid entering the center of the wrist in a cylindrical volume
         coaxial to z-axis. 


40014  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): wrist axis at undefined pos 

       Cause:
         The wrist, typically a SMART wrist, has axis 5 at zero position.
         For this position it is impossible to independently compute the
         values of axes 5, 4, and 6. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid working in Cartesian with axis 5 at zero position or, if
         implemented, change the setting of $ORNT_TYPE to WRIST_JNT in order
         to execute the trajectory in Cartesian, but interpolating the axes
         in joint. 


40015  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): limits <lower_lim>..<upper_lim> for
       system variables 

       Cause:
         The value assigned to a predefined variable is outside the
         specified range. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the assignment such that the value is within the
         range. 


40016  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): NODISABLE on a STATE condition 

       Cause:
         The NODISABLE condition handler attribute cannot be used if the
         condition handler contains state condition expressions (for example
         WHEN $DOUT[3] = TRUE). This is because the condition handler would
         remain enabled and the state would be continuously triggering. 

       Remedy:
         Change the type of condition expression to an event (for example
         WHEN $DOUT[3]+)  or remove the NODISABLE attribute. 


40017  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WITH bad FOR ARM number 

       Cause:
         The arm number specified in the FOR ARM condition handler attribute
         does not match the arm being referenced in the MOVE statement. For
         example: - -    CONDITION[1] FOR ARM[2]: -      WHEN HOLD DO -     
         LOCK -    ENDCONDITION -    . . . -    MOVE ARM[1] TO p1 WITH
         CONDITION[1] - arm 1 is being moved, but the condition handler is
         defined for arm 2. 

       Remedy:
         Redefine the condition handler or change the MOVE statement so the
         arm numbers are the same. 


40018  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WITH bad arm number for cond action 

       Cause:
         The FOR ARM was not specified in a condition handler definition and
         the condition handler contains actions which are arm related. This
         condition handler is being used in a MOVE statement and the arm at
         the time of the condition handler definition is different from the
         arm being moved. For example, - -  PROGRAM withact PROG_ARM=2 -  .
         . . -  BEGIN -    CONDITION[1]: -      WHEN HOLD DO -        LOCK  
         -- This applies to arm 2 (PROG_ARM) -    ENDCONDITION -    . . . - 
         -- Error since the LOCK action applies to arm 2 and -    -- arm 1
         is being moved -    MOVE ARM[1] TO p1 WITH CONDITION[1] -    . . .
         -  END withact - 

       Remedy:
         Correct the condition handler definition such that the arm used at
         condition handler definition time is the same as the arm being
         referenced in the MOVE statement. 


40019  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): held as step statement 

       Cause:
         A single statement has been executed and the step mode is
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         The program is suspended in the ready state. To continue the
         execution, press the START button or for NOHOLDable programs the
         RUN key can be pressed. 


40020  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): SCRN_CLEAR window not deleted 

       Cause:
         The SCRN_CLEAR built-in with operation mode SCRN_CLR_REM failed as
         one of the windows being displayed on the screen could not be
         removed because files were opened on the window. 

       Remedy:
         Close all files on the window before trying to remove the window
         and clear the screen. 


40021  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad number of binary chars 

       Cause:
         The number of binary characters actually read does not equal the
         number of binary characters requested to be read. This can occur
         when a file is opened in binary mode and there is insufficient data
         in the file. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the amount of bytes in the file or device is equal to
         the amount requested in the READ statement. 


40022  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): cannot EXIT CYCLE on active edit
       prog 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to EXIT CYCLE for the program which is
         currently being used in the PROGRAM EDIT or MEMORY DEBUG
         environments and the editor has control of the program (i.e., the
         red pop-up window is not being displayed). 

       Remedy:
         If EXIT CYCLE is needed, issue the command directly from the editor
         or move the cursor to the beginning and continue execution. 


40023  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): APPL_REQ error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The APPL_REQ built-in failed due to the specified error. Trapping
         on this error causes execution of the program to continue. The
         program predefined variable $APPL_STS is set to the specified
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


40024  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): internal access error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         An internal access failed due to the specified error. 

       Remedy:
         Please report this error to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


40025  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): axis 5 at undefined pos 

       Cause:
         The wrist has axis 5 at an undefined position. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid working in Cartesian with axis 5 at this undefined position
         or, if implemented, change the setting of $ORNT_TYPE to WRIST_JNT
         in order to execute the trajectory in Cartesian, but interpolate
         the wrist axes in joint. 


40026  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): held as a step mode 

       Cause:
         The step mode of the program has been changed. 

       Remedy:
         Informational message. No action is necessary. 


40027  2-WARNING <id_prog>(<num_linea>) CYCLE time
       violation:<violation_time> 

       Cause:
         The specified CYCLE time has been violated by the specified amount. 

       Remedy:
         Check the instructions being performed in the CYCLE loop as well as
         the specified time. 


40028  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): inverse kinematics not available 

       Cause:
         This machine does not have inverse kinematics. Or, in case of
         compensation algorithm active, it means that the programmed Joint
         or Cartesian position cannot be compensated. 

       Remedy:
         Do not try to work in Cartesian. Or, in case of compensation
         algorithm active, program the Joint or Cartesian position out of
         the area where the compensation algorithm cannot work. 


40029  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): 2nd Euler angle less than zero 

       Cause:
         For definition, the second Euler angle cannot be less than 0
         degrees or greater than 180 degrees. 

       Remedy:
         Set the angle accordingly. 


40030  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SCRN_SET edit not active 

       Cause:
         The setting of the screen to SCRN_EDIT using the SCRN_SET built-in
         failed as the editor is not active on the particular device. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the editor is active on the physical device. 


40031  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): XTND_IN_RANGE XTNDPOS not
       initialized 

       Cause:
         The XTND_IN_RANGE built-in failed because the XTNDPOS positional
         data has not been initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value passed to the built-in. 


40032  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): SYS_CALL timeout 

       Cause:
         The SYS_CALL has timed out and has therefore been canceled. The
         variable $SYS_CALL_TOUT can be used for setting this timeout value. 

       Remedy:
         Either change the timeout period or accept this error. 


40033  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WRITE error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The specified error occurred during an asynchronous WRITE
         operation. Due to the fact that many errors can be reported for the
         WRITE operation, this message is used so that the errors can be
         trapped. The predefined variable $FL_STS contains the specified
         error. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. 


40034  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WRITE timeout 

       Cause:
         The asynchronous WRITE operation has timed out. The program
         predefined variable $WRITE_TOUT can be used for specifying for how
         long the program should wait for the WRITE to complete. 

       Remedy:
         Check why the WRITE may not have completed in time and if necessary
         increase the timeout value. 


40035  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): WRITE not completed 

       Cause:
         The asynchronous WRITE operation did not complete for some reason,
         with only a partial amount of the data written. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value of $WRITE_TOUT and that the LUN was not closed or
         the program deactivated during the WRITE operation. 


40036  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): file closed on WRITE 

       Cause:
         The WRITE operation has been aborted because the LUN has been
         closed. 

       Remedy:
         Cancel the WRITE operation before attempting to close the file if
         this is a problem. 


40037  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad CANCEL semaphore 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to CANCEL a SEMAPHORE while programs are
         waiting on the SEMAPHORE. The CANCEL statement or action only has
         an effect if the SEMAPHORE has been signaled. 

       Remedy:
         Check which programs are waiting on the SEMAPHORE. 


40038  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): not ALL conds DISABLEd 

       Cause:
         The DISABLE CONDITION ALL statement failed with not all the
         conditions disabled. 

       Remedy:
         Check if any of the conditions are currently being used locally in
         a motion statement. 


40039  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): not ALL conditions PURGEd. Error
       <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The PURGE CONDITION ALL statement or action failed due to the
         specified reason with not all the conditions purged. 

       Remedy:
         Review the specified error to determine what action to take. Check
         if any of the conditions are currently being used locally in a
         motion statement. 


40040  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): DV_CNTRL operation error <code> 

       Cause:
         The operation specified in the DV_CNTRL built-in failed due to the
         specified error. 

       Remedy:
         Check the valid codes for device control access and the specified
         error. 


40041  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): WRITE has been canceled 

       Cause:
         A WRITE operation has been canceled. This is normally due to the
         fact that the program which issued the WRITE has been deactivated
         or the statement bypassed. If there are pending WRITEs, the data
         written may be inconsistent. 

       Remedy:
         This is only a warning. No action is necessary. 


40042  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad screen name 

       Cause:
         The screen name supplied to the SCRN_CREATE or SCRN_DEL built-in is
         not valid or cannot be found. 

       Remedy:
         Check the use of the built-in and see that a name between 1 and 8
         characters has been specified and that it does exist. 


40043  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad screen operation 

       Cause:
         The attempted operation on a screen is not legal. 

       Remedy:
         Check what operation was being performed and verify that this is a
         correct operation for the type of screen. For example, the system
         screen (SCRN_SYS) cannot be deleted or removed. 


40044  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): screen exists 

       Cause:
         The screen already exists. 

       Remedy:
         An attempt was made to create a new screen (SCRN_CREATE) but it
         already exists. When this error is trapped on the value returned
         from the SCRN_CREATE built-in is the same as the existing screen. 


40045  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): asynchronous builtin error
       <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The specified error occurred during an operation on a PATH. 

       Remedy:
         Review the error to determine the exact cause and necessary remedy. 


40046  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $TIMER ATTACHed 

       Cause:
         The $TIMER is already ATTACHed by another program. 

       Remedy:
         Use a different $TIMER element. 


40047  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): built-in timeout 

       Cause:
         An asynchronous built-in operation has timed out and has therefore
         been canceled. The $SYS_CALL_TOUT predefined variable can be used
         for setting this timeout value. 

       Remedy:
         Either change the timeout period or accept this error. 


40048  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad turn configuration flag 

       Cause:
         The user sets a turn flag on a joint that cannot do more than 360
         degrees. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the turn configuration for the positional variable. 


40049  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad SIGNAL SEGMENT as no waiting
       path 

       Cause:
         The SIGNAL SEGMENT statement failed because no motion is currently
         waiting on a PATH. 

       Remedy:
         The signalling of a PATH is different from a SEMAPHORE in that
         there is no counter.  A PATH can only be signalled if a motion is
         waiting. 


40050  0-INFO This is used to allow trapping on of conditions 


40051  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): bad state for KEY_LOCK 

       Cause:
         The KEY_LOCK built-in failed because either the state selector is
         not LOCAL or REMOTE or the editor, teach, or EXECUTE is active on
         the device. 

       Remedy:
         Reissue the built-in when in the correct state. 


40052  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): no condition action specified 

       Cause:
         A CONDITION has been defined which contains a condition expression
         but no corresponding action. 

       Remedy:
         Either trap on the error so that there is no action or insert some
         form of action. 


40053  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): string has no length 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to assign or set a STRING variable which has no
         length. This occurs when the STRING is defined as STRING[*] and the
         length has not been defined in another program or when a variable
         file was loaded. 

       Remedy:
         Set the string length or load a variable file that contains the
         variable value and a length. 


40054  4-PAUSE <id_prog>(<num_linea>): Invalid CNTRL_GET argument:
       <enumeration> 

       Cause:
         The enumeration for CNTRL_GET information was invalid. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value passed in as the argument. 


40055  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): $UFRAME not initialized 

       Cause:
         The value of $UFRAME is not initialized. 

       Remedy:
         Check and modify the value of $UFRAME.

40059  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): AUX_SET error <error_num> 

       Cause:
         The AUX_SET built-in failed due to an error. In order to avoid the
         program to be suspended it is needed to issue an ERR_TRAP_ON on
         this error. For example: "40059 - 4 pippo(5): AUX_SET error 37194";
         issue an ERR_TRAP_ON(40059) for not sospending the program pippo. 

       Remedy:
         For understanding what caused the alarm, please check the meaning
         of the associated error. In the example, the description of the
         cause and the remedy of 37194 has to be looked for. 


40060  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): Cartesian Position not compensable 

       Cause:
         In case of compensation algorithm active, it means that the
         programmed Joint or Cartesian position cannot be compensated. 

       Remedy:
         In case of compensation algorithm active, program the Joint or
         Cartesian position out of the area where the compensation algorithm
         cannot work. 


40061  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): flow modulate already enabled 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the FLOW_MOD_ON is called twice from the
         same program. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the second call to FLOW_MOD_ON. 


40062  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): flow modulate already disabled 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the FLOW_MOD_OFF is called twice from the
         same program. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the second call to FLOW_MOD_OFF. 


40063  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): ON_POS already enabled 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the ON_POS(ON) is called twice on the same
         element of the $ON_POS_TBL.

40135  0-INFO <prog_id>(<line_num>): I/O points not configured 

       Cause:
         No I/O point is currently configured. 

       Remedy:
         I/Os need to be configured. 


40136  0-INFO <prog_id>(<line_num>):system variable <variable> is
       deprecated 

       Cause:
         Program being translated contains deprecated predefined variables. 

       Remedy:
         Remove ot change the access to the specified variable. 


40137  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): statement disallowed in DRIVE
       OFF/STANDBY 

       Cause:
         This statement can be executed only when the DRIVES are ON. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the DRIVES are ON before executing this statement. 


40138  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): statement disallowed in HOLD 

       Cause:
         This statement can be executed only when the robot is NOT HELD. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the robot is NOT held before executing this statement. 


40139  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): Device not found 

       Cause:
         The indicated device is not present in the configuration. 

       Remedy:
         Check the name of the device. 


40140  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): I/O not configured 

       Cause:
         The handling of I/Os in inactive. 

       Remedy:
         Check the I/O configuration. 


40141  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): region already enabled 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the IR_SWHITCH(ON) is called twice on the
         same $IR_TBL element. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the second call to the IR_SWITCH(ON). 


40142  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): region already disabled 

       Cause:
         This error occurs when the IR_SWITCH(OFF) is called on a $IR_TBL
         element which is already available. 

       Remedy:
         Review the program in order to determine the cause of the error
         (for example two consecutive calls to the IR_SWITCH(OFF)). 


40143  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): active motion on axis 

       Cause:
         The axis on which the motion is required via the predefined routine
         ARM_MOVE is already executing a movement issued via a MOVE
         statement. 

       Remedy:
         Check the flow  of the program calling the routine. Eventually add
         a test on the speed threshold of the axis
         $CRNT_DATA[num_arm].C_AREAL_2D[4,num_asse]. 


40144  2-WARNING <prog_id>(<line_num>): predefined routine already active 

       Cause:
         The ARM_MOVE predefined routine is being executed on the requested
         arm. 

       Remedy:
         Verify the flow of the program which calls the routine, checking
         that the value of the $CRNT_DATA[arm_num].C_ALONG_1D[2] is 0. 


40145  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): No CATCH for RAISE value 

       Cause:
         A RAISE was issued but the specified value is not being caught. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the value being raised is caught. 


40146  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): RETRY/SKIP only valid in CATCH 

       Cause:
         RETRY/SKIP are only valid when the error has been caught. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the statement is within a TRY clause. 


40147  4-PAUSE <prog_id>(<line_num>): RETRY limit exceeded 

       Cause:
         RETRY can only be used a limited number of times within the same
         CATCH. 

       Remedy:
         Check the number of times that RETRY has been attempted.

         properly. 


47106  0-INFO Error closing .ERR file 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to close the <file_name>.ERR file. This is the
         file that contains the list of all errors detected during the
         translation of a file of variables. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the RAM DISK is not full and otherwise delete the unused
         files. Try to delete the VTRANS.ERR file and issue the command
         again in order to translate the file of variables. 


47107  0-INFO Error closing the input file 

       Cause:
         The file to be translated could not be closed. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the RAM DISK is not full and otherwise delete the unused
         files. Issue the translate command again. 


47108  0-INFO Error opening .ERR file 

       Cause:
         An error occurred trying to open <file_name>.ERR for reporting
         translation errors. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the file is not protected, and erase the file if it
         exists. 


47109  0-INFO The specified type is invalid 

       Cause:
         The variable or field type is not valid. 

       Remedy:
         The variable type must be one of the pre-defined variable types
         (like int, rea, boo, etc.). 


47110  0-INFO No integer array dimension was found 


47111  0-INFO [ expected but not found 

       Cause:
         The bracket was expected but not found. 

       Remedy:
         The bracket was assumed present and translation continued.  Add the
         bracket at the proper location to remove this warning. 


47112  0-INFO ] expected but not found 

       Cause:
         The bracket was expected but not found. 

       Remedy:
         The bracket was assumed present and translation continued.  Add the
         bracket at the proper location to remove this warning. 


47113  0-INFO Value for len, arm, ax, or field not found 

       Cause:
         The integer value for a label could not be found.  A label was used
         where a string length, arm number, axis number, number of fields or
         number of nodes was expected but the value of the label could not
         be found in the file. 

       Remedy:
         Add the labeled integer value to the file and retranslate. 


47114  0-INFO Len, arm, ax, or field id misspelled 

       Cause:
         The label for an integer value could not be found exactly.  A label
         that matched closely was found and used.  A match is considered
         close enough if the labels match in the first two characters. 

       Remedy:
         Either fix the spelling for the label or add the proper label to
         the file. 


47116  0-INFO Missing len, arm, ax, or field id 

       Cause:
         A labeled integer was expected for the string length, arm number,

47118  0-INFO Token exceeds maximum length 

       Cause:
         A token is too long and causes an overflow of the translators
         buffer. 

       Remedy:
         Shorten the identifier in the file. 


47119  0-INFO Invalid array dim 1 

       Cause:
         The declared size of an array is either less than 1 or greater than
         65535. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the array dimensions are within the valid range. 


47120  0-INFO Invalid array dim 2 

       Cause:
         The declared size of an array is either less than 1 or greater than
         65535. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure the array dimensions are within the valid range. 


47121  0-INFO Invalid arm number 

       Cause:
         The arm number specified is greater than the maximum number of arms
         allowed in the system. 

       Remedy:
         The arm number must be less than 32. 


47124  0-INFO Invalid number of aux axes 

       Cause:
         The number of aux axes must be between 0 and 4. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the number of aux axes in the file to fall inside the allowable
         range. 


47125  0-INFO Invalid string length 

       Cause:
         The string length must be between 1 and 254. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the string length to a valid size. 


47126  0-INFO Priv/Xport code missing, assuming Priv 

       Cause:
         The private or exported code was missing from a variable
         definition. The variable was assumed to be private. 

       Remedy:

         must be either TRUE, FALSE, ON, or OFF. 

       Remedy:
         Change the value to one of the valid values. 


47128  0-INFO Len, arm, ax, or field not specified 

       Cause:
         The value for a labeled integer value was missing.  The value for
         the string length, arm number, number of fields, number of nodes,
         number of aux axes, etc was missing. 

       Remedy:
         Add the value for the proper definition field. 


47129  0-INFO No available memory for buffer 

       Cause:
         The translation process ran out of free memory. 

       Remedy:
         Erase all unnecessary data from memory and retranslate. 


47130  0-INFO Invalid or missing value 

       Cause:
         The data type of the value found does not match the type expected. 
         For example a REAL value was found when an INTEGER value was
         expected. 

       Remedy:
         Make sure that the type of the value matches the type expected for
         the value. 


47131  0-INFO Valid field id not found 

       Cause:
         The pre-defined field id was not a valid name. 

       Remedy:
         Fix the field name to match a valid pre-defined field name. 


47132  0-INFO Invalid field for this data type 

       Cause:
         The pre-defined or user defined field is not a member of the
         record, node or path variable. 

       Remedy:
         Either define the field for the type or remove the field value from
         the variable definition. 


47133  0-INFO Truncating over-length string 

       Cause:
         The value of a string exceeds the declared size of the string.  The
         string was truncated so that translation could continue. 

       Remedy:
         Either increase the declared size of the string or shorten the
         length of the string value. 


47134  0-INFO No available memory for environment 

       Cause:
         The translation process ran out of free memory. 

       Remedy:
         Erase all unnecessary data from memory and retranslate. 


47135  0-INFO Ignoring out of context item <element> 

       Cause:
         The extra token was found and ignored. 

       Remedy:
         Remove the extra token from the file. 


47136  0-INFO Ignoring duplicate field definition 

       Cause:
         The pre-defined field or user defined field already exists for the
         record or node definition.

         only contains valid characters. 


47140  0-INFO Missing name after reserved word TYPE 

       Cause:
         The name for a user defined type is missing. 

       Remedy:
         Add the name for the user defined type after the reserved word
         TYPE. 


47141  0-INFO Missing or invalid type name 

       Cause:
         The type name for a record, array of records, node, or path is
         invalid.  Either the type is not defined in the variable file or
         there were errors in the type definition. 

       Remedy:
         Either add the type definition to the file or fix the errors in the
         definition. 


47142  0-INFO Field ignored due to error 

       Cause:
         An error occurred trying to create the field in the user defined
         type. 

       Remedy:
         Check the previous error to determine the cause and proper solution
         for the error. 


47143  0-INFO Num fields read does not match expected 

       Cause:
         The actual number of fields read for a user defined type does not
         match the number expected. 

       Remedy:
         Either remove the extra fields or adjust the number of fields
         specified at the start of the type definition. 


47144  0-INFO No fields for user defined type 

       Cause:
         No fields were found for a user defined type. 

       Remedy:
         Either remove the user defined type or add fields to it. 


47145  0-INFO Invalid number of fields specified 

       Cause:
         The number of fields specified for a user defined type is not
         valid. 

       Remedy:

52778  8-HOLD RPU run-down battery 

       Cause:
         The battery of the RPU rack run-down. It's status is checked any
         time in which the controller is switched on and it is also checked
         every 5 seconds. 

       Remedy:
         If the controller has been switched off many consecutive times, the
         battery needs a time for totally recovering the power and it is
         suggested to maintain the controller switched on for at least 16
         hours in order to allowe the restore. Otherwise it is suggested to
         replace the battery, due to the usury of it, in order to correctly
         recover the system after a power down. Please verify the efficiency
         of the battery with the procedure described in the maintenance
         manual.

57349  2-WARNING CPU: <servo_num> wrong value for $CT_JNT_MASK 

       Cause:
         The axis involved in $CONV_TBL[i].CT_JNT_MASK (where 'i' is 1 or 2)
         is not allowed to be an external position transducer because it is
         already linked to a predefined arm. As a consequence the system
         variable has been ignored and set to the zero value; the conveyor
         tracking/reading is not yet configured. 

       Remedy:
         Check the correct value for the $CONV_TBL[i].CT_JNT_MASK. Remember
         that the mask must consider the phisical channel of the axis linked
         to the external position transducer used for the conveyor tracking.

57352  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> $CAL_DATA not valid 

       Cause:
         Calibration constants that have been saved in the retentive memory
         are not valid, out of range or numerically wrong (NAN, INF). In
         case of command CARL_Motor, possible inconsistency with
         $ARM_DATA[].ARM_ID not valid. 

       Remedy:
         For initializing calibration constants it is needed to execute the
         calibration of the axis involved.

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


57361  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> auxiliary axis not
       configured 

       Cause:
         The auxiliary axis is not configured correctly. 

       Remedy:
         Configure the auxiliary axis again with the predefined tool,
         checking that the type of axis (X,Y,Z) is explicitly declared. 


57362  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> arm MASTER not correctly configured 

       Cause:
         The MASTER arm for the Axes Pursuit option is not configured
         correctly. 

       Remedy:
         Configure the MASTER arm with the variable $AX_PURSUIT_ARM_MASTER,
         and be sure that its value is consistent. 


57363  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> arm SLAVE not correctly configured 

       Cause:
         The SLAVE arm for the Axes Pursuit option is not configured
         correctly. 

       Remedy:
         Configure the SLAVE arm with the variable $AX_PURSUIT_LINKED, and
         be sure that its value is consistent (es.
         $ARM_DATA[2].AX_PURSUIT_LINKED[1] := 7). 


57364  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> the axes of MASTER arm
       does not exist 

       Cause:
         The axes of the MASTER arm for the Axes Pursuit option does not
         exist. 

       Remedy:
         Be sure that the variables $AX_PURSUIT_LINKED have been set with a
         correct value for the axes for the MASTER arm (ex.
         $ARM_DATA[2].AX_PURSUIT_LINKED[1] := 7, axes 7 must exist on the
         MASTER arm). 


57365  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> the axes of SLAVE arm
       does not exist 

       Cause:
         The axes of the SLAVE arm for the Axes Pursuit option does not
         exist. 

       Remedy:
         Be sure that the variables $AX_PURSUIT_LINKED have been set with a
         correct value for the axes for the SLAVE arm (ex.
         $ARM_DATA[2].AX_PURSUIT_LINKED[1] := 7, axes 2 must exist on the
         SLAVE arm). 


57366  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> More than one SLAVE arm is configured 

       Cause:
         The system includes more than one SLAVE arm; the inconsistency does
         not allow the system with Axes Pursuit function enabled to work
         correctly. 

       Remedy:
         Control that the variables $AX_PURSUIT_LINKED are correctly
         configured for one SLAVE arm (ex. the following configuration:
         $ARM_DATA[2].AX_PURSUIT_LINKED[1] := 7 and
         $ARM_DATA[3].AX_PURSUIT_LINKED[2] := 3 is not correct as it is
         declaring arm 2 and arm 3 as SLAVE arms, but for Axes Pursuit
         option it only one SLAVE arm per time is possible. 


57367  11-DRIVE OFF ACP node <node>  not connected 

       Cause:
         The specified device is not connected to the system. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the device is physically connected to the system. Check
         that the device is properly configured. The cause  might derive
         from the upstream device which, interrupting the communication on
         the Powerlink, could cause connection problems. 


57368  11-DRIVE OFF ACP node <node> connected 

       Cause:

57370  11-DRIVE OFF The application in $TRK_TBL[<arm_num>] does not exist 

       Cause:
         An unimplemented tracking application has been requested. 

       Remedy:
         Check the $TRK_TBL[nTbl].TT_APPL_ID variable and, eventually,
         correct the value. 


57371  11-DRIVE OFF More arms configured in $TRK_TBL[<arm_num>] 

       Cause:
         In the system more than one arm have been configured. The required
         track modality cannot properly work with this configuration.

         arm. 


57372  11-DRIVE OFF Bad arm configuration in $TRK_TBL[<arm_num>] 

       Cause:
         Bad arm configuration in the table, the arm does not exists or is
         already configured on a different table. This missing or wrong
         parameter does notallows a proper functioning of the system. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value of the $TRK_TBL[nTbl].TT_ARM_MASK variable for the
         associated $FMI and, in case of Versamotion, that it is declared in
         a single $TRK_TBL[] table. 


57373  11-DRIVE OFF Wrong port type in $TRK_TBL[<arm_num>] 

       Cause:

58880  10-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> error upon DRIVE ON 

       Cause:
         The servo area does not recognizes a DRIVE ON request. The state is
         ALARM probably due to errors related to motors/encoder. 

       Remedy:
         Analize the errors previously displayed on the controller and reset
         the alarm state. Issue the DRIVE ON again. 


58881  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> axis in a state
       different from what expected (0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to send the command due the actual axis state.
         This is probably due to errors previously occurred and not reset. 

       Remedy:
         Analize the errors previously displayed on the controller and reset
         the alarm state. Issue the command again. 


58882  4-PAUSE Arm <arm_num> DRIVE OFF already in progress 

       Cause:
         The DRIVE OFF procedure has already been activated by another
         command or by an error condition. 

       Remedy:
         Check if errors previously occurred. 


58883  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> timeout for axes disabling 

       Cause:
         The DRIVE OFF procedure did not complete in the foreseen time. The
         status of some axes indicates that the procedure didn't correctly
         complete. 

       Remedy:
         Analize errors previously displayed on the controller. 


58884  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> timeout for drive enabling(sts:<param>) 

       Cause:
         The power activating procedure on the drive did not complete in the
         foreseen time. The drive is in the state indicated by the (sts)
         parameter associated to the message. Something avoided the bus to
         reach the required voltage. 

       Remedy:
         Analize errors previously displayed on the controller. 


58885  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> timeout on axes enabling
       (sts:0x<param1>-0x<param2>) 

       Cause:
         At least one axis did not complete the enabling procedure. The
         first status parameter indicates the mask of axes that are required
         to be enabled. The second status parameter indicates the mask of
         axes that successfully completed the operation. 

       Remedy:
         Analize errors previously displayed on the controller. 


58886  4-PAUSE Arm <arm_num> drive not active (sts:<param>) 

       Cause:
         The drive is no more in the active state when the command for axes
         enabling has been received. The drive state is the parameter
         associated to this error message. 

       Remedy:
         Analize errors previously displayed on the controller. 


58887  4-PAUSE Arm <arm_num> interruption of drive activation
       (sts:<param>) 

       Cause:
         The activation command has been interrupted during the first DRIVE
         ON phase. The drive state is indicated with this message. 

       Remedy:
         Analize errors previously displayed on the controller. 


58888  4-PAUSE Arm <arm_num> drive not ready for activation (sts:<param>) 

       Cause:
         The drives activation command cannot be sent because the drive is
         not in a state that allows to handle this command. 

       Remedy:
         Analize errors previously displayed on the controller. 


58889  4-PAUSE Arm <arm_num> drive not disabled (sts:<param>) 

       Cause:
         The drive disable phase did not complete in the foreseen time. The
         drive state is reported with this error message. The DRIVE OFF
         procedure completed in any case. 

       Remedy:
         Analize errors previously displayed on the controller. 


58890  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> timeout in calibration/turnset
       procedure(Axf: <param>) 

       Cause:
         The calibration or turn_set procedure, for axes identified by the
         "AxF" mask, did not complete in time. 

       Remedy:
         Analize the errors previously viewed on the controller. 


58891  10-DRIVE OFF Maximum power absorbed 

       Cause:
         The robot cycle time is stressing the controller which could
         overheat. One or more axes could be moving with a braked axis. 

       Remedy:
         The work cycle could overload the robot. Please change, if
         possible, the trajectory so to remove axes from an excessive
         stress. If the problem persists, it is needed to analize the robot
         ability  as far as concerns the work cycle and the system should be
         tuned accordingly to other system parameters. Verify that the
         connections to the brakes are not open.

       Cause:
         Servo CPU system pool does not have enough available memory for the
         system software request. 

       Remedy:
         Report this error to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com).  The user
         cannot solve this problem. 


59393  10-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> timeout on DSP driver 

       Cause:
         Handshaking with the servo control driver failed; no response from
         it after a request. The servo driver task could be aborted. 

       Remedy:
         Report this error to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). The user
         cannot solve this problem. 


59394  8-HOLD Arm <tbl_num> not enabled for $TRK_TBL[<arm_num>] 

       Cause:
         It has been requested the enabling on an arm which is not currently
         enabled for that table element. 

       Remedy:
         Check the table configuration and the correctness of  parameters
         specified in the predefined routine. 


59395  8-HOLD Conveyor in $TRK_TBL[<tbl_num>] active on arm <arm_num> 

       Cause:
         It has been requested the initialization/enabling of a conveyor
         which is already active on the arm. 

       Remedy:
         Check the correctness of the conveyor table element to be used or
         deactivate the tracking before initializing or reactivating it. 


59396  8-HOLD Command not foreseen in CONV_TRACK routine 

       Cause:
         An uncorrect command has been required in the CONV_TRACK predefined
         routine. 

       Remedy:
         Input the correct value of the command. 


59397  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> servo calibration
       aborted 

       Cause:
         The servo control does not accept the theoretical position during
         the startup phase or during calibration/turn-set/JNT_SET_TAR
         operations. If the servo control is not properly reading the
         position transducer this error occurs. 

       Remedy:
         Check the position transducer circuits. If the problem persists,
         report it to COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


59398  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> axis not configured 

       Cause:
         The user is trying to calibrate and/or turn-set an axes which is
         not declared for the system. 

       Remedy:
         Do not calibrate and/or turn-set an undeclared axes. 


59399  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> calibration data not valid 

       Cause:
         The user is trying to turn-set an axis for which the calibration
         error is not valid. 

       Remedy:
         Analyze the history of the .C5G system data file. This file should
         contain the correct calibration error for each axes saved at
         calibration time. If it is not corrupted, load it, while drives are
         off, and reexecute the procedure. If the file was saved following
         the instructions, this axes now has a valid calibration error. If
         the file is corrupted, load the calibration error from the NVRAM,
         and reexecute the turn-set procedure. If the error does not vanish,
         the NVRAM data are also not valid. The axes need to be
         recalibrated. If the error does vanish, during the calibration
         procedure or after someone did not follow the instructions properly
         working with the system data files. 


59400  2-WARNING Arm <arm_num> attempted operation in drive off 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to execute the calibration/turn-set operation
         when not in PROG state. 

       Remedy:
         Enter PROG state before executing the procedure. 


59401  8-HOLD Error in $TRK_TBL[<tbl_num>] parameters 

       Cause:
         The table element specified in the predefined routine has wrong
         parameters. 

       Remedy:
         Please check the table configuration and the correctness of
         parameters inside. 


59402  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> arm not calibrated 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to execute MOVE instructions when the arm is not
         calibrated. 

       Remedy:
         Calibrate or turn-set the arm before executing MOVE instructions. 


59403  8-HOLD Motion request mismatch with system state 

       Cause:
         Immediate execution MOVE statements are accepted only in PROG
         state. 

       Remedy:
         Enter PROG state before executing a MOVE statement. 


59404  8-HOLD Conveyor in $TRK_TBL[<tbl_num>] non inizialized for Arm
       <arm_num> 

       Cause:
         It has been requested to activate a conveyor which is not
         initialized yet for the Arm. 

       Remedy:
         Please check the correctness of the conveyor table to use and
         initialize the tracking before enabling it. 


59405  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> bad operation with pending motion 

       Cause:
         There are pending MOVE statements already executed by the
         interpreter but not yet executed by the interpolator when the user
         is trying to calibrate/turn-set an arm. The same message is sent
         when the AUX_COOP, ARM_COOP or ARM_SOFT built-in's are executed
         during a movement; this can happen if an ADVANCE clause is present
         on a MOVE statement before the built-in's or if built-in's are just
         at the beginning of the program (at the start of the program, a
         recovery movement is performed). 

       Remedy:
         DEACTIVATE all the programs before the calibration/turn-set
         procedure. If the message is due to the cooperation, the ADVANCE
         clause before AUX_COOP, ARM_COOP or ARM_SOFT built-in's must be
         removed. If built-in's are just at the beginning of a program they
         are to be moved down or a DELAY statement is to be introduced
         before them. 


59406  8-HOLD Conveyor in $TRK_TBL[<num_tbl>] not active on Arm <num_arm> 

       Cause:
         Required deactivation for a conveyor not active on this Arm. 

       Remedy:
         Check conveyor number to deactivate. 


59407  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> $STRK_END_P out of range 

       Cause:
         The user $STRK_END_P[i] predefined variable has an absolute value
         greater than the corresponding system value $STRK_END_SYS[1][i]. 

       Remedy:
         Restrict the user stroke end. 


59408  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> $STRK_END_N out of range 

       Cause:
         The user $STRK_END_N[i] predefined variable has an absolute value
         greater than the corresponding system value $STRK_END_SYS[2][i]. 

       Remedy:
         Restrict the user stroke end. 


59409  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> joint position not accurate
       enough 

       Cause:
         During the turn-set procedure the user should move the arm near the
         calibration references. If the position is not so accurate, there
         could be problems due to position transducer wrap and the operation
         will fail. 

       Remedy:
         Move the arm as close as possible to the references. 


59410  8-HOLD START/BACK not available 

       Cause:
         The START/BACK keys are currently disabled.  This occurs after
         certain errors or when a manual motion is executed outside the EDIT
         environment.  The START/BACK keys only work in PROG state when the
         motion was issued from within the EDIT environment. The EDIT
         environment includes PROGRAM EDIT/DATA,  MEMORY DEBUG, immediate
         mode EXECUTE (E). 

       Remedy:
         If the keys are disabled due to an error, clear the error. 
         Otherwise, enter the EDIT environment (PROGRAM EDIT/DATA, MEMORY
         DEBUG, immediate mode EXECUTE). 


59411  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> motion after last reset
       (<reason>) 

       Cause:
         The position transducer detects  a quote, at startup time,
         different than the one stored before the power down. This could be
         due to: the slipping of an axis (with or without a MOVE) during the
         powering off (<reason>=1); or to an error preceeding the switching
         off which caused the loss of the turn-set (<reason>=1); or to the
         shutdown of an axis with the system switched off (for example
         during the transportation) (<reason>=2); or to the detection, upon
         controller restart, of a conflict between the position read by the
         encoder and the one read by the device which stores the quote
         (retentive memory NVRAM) (<reason>=2). 

       Remedy:
         In case of (<reason>=1) and loss of Turn-set, please verify the
         errors which precede this one. In case of(<reason>=2)please contact
         COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). In case of problems in the
         encoder, other errors related to the encoder could be present;
         check which are these errors and it would probably be needed to
         replace the encoder. In case of problems in the NVRAM, please
         replace the APC. 


59412  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> influencing axis not
       calibrated 

       Cause:
         An attempt was made to execute a turn-set operation on an axes
         which has an influence on another one and the influencing axes is
         not already calibrated. 

       Remedy:
         The influencing axes should be properly calibrated before trying to
         calibrate the influenced one. 


59413  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> interpolator already running 

       Cause:
         An attempt to execute a motion while the interpolator is already
         active was done.  The motion stack is already full, so it is no
         longer possible to stack moves other than if they are coming from
         the same program. An exeception is an immediate mode EXECUTE (E)
         MOVE.  Only one immediate mode EXECUTE (E) MOVE is accepted. 

       Remedy:
         CANCEL the motion which is active, this leaves the stacked motions
         as they are, but now it is possible to execute another motion. 


59414  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> general recovery error 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to recover the interrupted motion. Sometimes
         this could happen if the recovery is done in Cartesian and there is
         a mismatch in the configuration flags. 

       Remedy:
         Set $RCVR_TYPE in order to do the recovery in joint or if it is not
         strictly necessary to recover, DEACTIVATE or CANCEL the interrupted
         motion. 


59415  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> $RCVR_TYPE doesn't permit recovery 

       Cause:
         $RCVR_TYPE setting does not permit the recovery session. 

       Remedy:
         Set $RCVR_TYPE to a different value or if it is not necessary to
         recover anything, DEACTIVATE the program.

59417  2-WARNING Already at the initial position. Line:<motion_line_num> 

       Cause:
         The user pressed the BACK button when the arm is already at the
         initial position of this segment. 

       Remedy:
         It is not possible to go backwards any further. 


59418  2-WARNING Final position reached. Line:<motion_line_num> 

       Cause:
         The arm has reached the final position. If the user releases and
         presses again the START button, the motion is completed, otherwise
         the user is still able to move backwards on this motion. 


59419  2-WARNING Initial position reached. Line:<motion_line_num> 

       Cause:
         The arm has reached the initial position and therefore cannot go
         backwards any further. The user is still able to move forwards on
         this motion. 


59420  2-WARNING Recovery position reached. Line:<motion_line_num> 

       Cause:
         The arm has reached the recovery position. If the user releases and
         presses again the START button, the next motion will start. 


59421  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> positive adjustment is
       required 

       Cause:
         During the turn-set procedure the user should move the arm near the
         calibration references. The position is accurate but not so much.
         The controller is requesting the user to move the arm in the
         positive direction. 

       Remedy:
         Move the arm in the positive direction and issue the command again. 


59422  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> negative adjustment is
       required 

       Cause:
         During the turn-set procedure the user should move the arm near the
         calibration references. The position is accurate but not so much.
         The controller is requesting the user to move the arm in the
         negative direction. 

       Remedy:
         Move the arm in the negative direction and issue the command again.

59424  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> bad working arm 

       Cause:
         The arm belongs to a robot family not suitable for being a worker
         arm. 

       Remedy:
         Check the correctness of parameters in the ARM_COOP predefined
         routine call. 


59425  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> bad auxiliary axes 

       Cause:
         The auxiliary axis is not part of a group of axes or is not
         suitable for being a positioner. 

       Remedy:
         Check the correctness of the configuration of the axis specified in
         the predefined routine AUX_COOP. 


59426  8-HOLD Synchronized arm cannot move 

       Cause:
         The user is trying to execute a SYNCMOVE when the synchronized arm
         cannot move (i.e. is not calibrated or is disabled or is locked). 

       Remedy:
         Check the status of the sync arm. 


59427  8-HOLD $TP_ORNT wrong value 

       Cause:
         The $TP_ORNT system variable has been assigned an invalid value. 

       Remedy:

       Cause:
         It is not possible to execute MOVE statements when the gun axis is
         not calibrated. 

       Remedy:
         Calibrate the axis of the gun using the proper application program
         before executing any MOVE statement. 


59437  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> feature not available 

       Cause:

       Remedy:
         Do not try to work in Soft Servo modality. 


59438  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DRIVE OFF for disabling
       the dynamic model 

       Cause:
         In order to execute the calibration or the turn-set of an axis, the
         dynamic model must be disabled for avoiding a strong variation of
         the axis position. The axis which requires the calibration /
         turn-set is brought back to the basic turn. 

       Remedy:
         It is needed to execute the calibration /turn-set upon the next
         DRIVE ON, because, being the dynamic model not enabled, the robot
         is not calibrated. 


59439  10-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> DRIVE OFF for disabling the dynamic
       model 

       Cause:
         In order to execute the calibration or the turn-set of an axis, the
         dynamic model must be disabled for avoiding  strong variations of
         the axes positions. The axes are brought back to the basic turn and
         the calibration is lost. 

       Remedy:
         It is needed to execute the calibration /turn-set upon the next
         DRIVE ON, because, being the dynamic model not enabled, the robot
         is not calibrated. 


59440  4-PAUSE Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> recovery motion not executed
       (err: <err_num>) 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to execute the recovery of the motion on the
         trajectory due to the error occurred  during the trajectory
         planning phase. 

       Remedy:
         Check the error code of the fourth parameter ant try yo remove the
         cause of it. 


59441  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> axis SIK in drive off 

       Cause:
         A calibration or a turn set operation  has been issued on axes
         equipped with SIK device. The operation failed because the drives
         were off. 

       Remedy:
         Do not calibrate or turn set on axes when the state of the system
         is DRIVE OFF. Retry after having executed the AUX_DRIVES (ON)
         built-in procedure. 


59442  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> arm in turn set 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to execute MOVE statements with the arm in turn. 

       Remedy:
         Execute the turn-set procedure before issuing any MOVE. 


59443  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> thresholds not computable 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to compute the sensibility thresholds for the
         Collision Detection, because the dynamic model cannot be enabled on
         this arm. 

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


59444  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> feature not configured 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to move the axis only with the control of the
         speed because this arm is not properly configured. 

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


59445  10-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> bad operation with pending motion 

       Cause:
         There are pending MOVE statements already executed by the
         interpreter but not yet executed by the interpolator when the user
         is trying to calibrate/turn-set an arm. The same message is sent
         when the AUX_COOP, ARM_COOP o ARM_SOFT built-in's are executed
         during a movement; this can happen if an ADVANCE clause is present

         at the beginning of the program (at the start of the program, a
         recovery movement is performed). 

       Remedy:
         DEACTIVATE all the programs before the calibration/turn-set
         procedure. If the message is due to the cooperation, the ADVANCE
         clause before AUX_COOP, ARM_COOP o ARM_SOFT built-in's must be
         removed. If built-in's are just at the beginning of a program they

       Cause:
         The error bit is set in the EnDat 2.2 encoder. The position
         measurement is not valid. 

       Remedy:
         Check the status of the encoder and replace it if damaged. 


60952  2-WARNING Board <board_num> - 7211:DC bus: Voltage drop - check the
       power line 

       Cause:
         The voltage has fallen, or dropped to a lower value. This may be
         due to a hole in the network or because one or more phases have
         failed. 

       Remedy:
         Check the value of the voltage and check the connections of the
         three phases L1, L2, L3. 


60953  2-WARNING Board <board_num> - 7215:error in power supply phases 

       Cause:
         At least one of the three power supply phases of the drive is
         absent. 

       Remedy:
         Check the presence of the phases on the drive power supply. 


60954  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <num_asse> Arm <num_arm> - Drive not ready 

       Cause:
         L'azionamento relativo all'asse, non  sincrono (riconosciuto)
         sulla rete Powerlink, e/o,  in uno stato non idoneo a gestire la
         sua abilitazione (drive on). 

       Remedy:
         E' importante verificare la sequenza di errori precedenti, potrebbe
         non essere sufficiente una ripartenza o spegnimento del controllo,
         ma necessaria, la sostituzione del modulo. 


60955  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> - Homing not present 

       Cause:
         The transducer  clearing procedure (HOMING) has not been issued, or
         it did not complete due to an axis error 

       Remedy:
         Check the connections with the transducer  , eventually replace it
         if needed. Observe the sequence of errors previously occurred; if
         one of these is the cause of the lost of the calibration data (the
         axis requires a TURN-SET), it is needed a system restart or
         shutdown. 


60956  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> - Enabling not present 

       Cause:

61955  11-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> negative electrical stroke end 

       Cause:
         The axis has reached the lower negative hardware limit switch .
         This is the second protection level before the axis reaches the
         mechanical limit switch. Usually this alarm occurs when an axis
         that is not calibrated goes over the software limit or when the
         electric sensor is activated before the software checks whether the
         axis is over the limit. If this happens and the axis is calibrated,
         check the axis calibration and/or the regulation of the sensor.
         Otherwise perhaps the sensor does not receive the power supply, the
         cable may be broken or the module internal circuit that makes the
         control could be open. 

       Remedy:
         Use the alarm exclusion mode (tasto <EXCL> key ) and move the axis
         manually.

61963  14-FATAL Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP fault counting encoder
       impulses (sts 0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows an hardware error (<param> = stsHW).
         The encoder reading (with Hiperface command) exceeded of 5
         mechanical degrees  the expected value calculated by the DSP
         impulse counter. Probably a breakdown or a false contact in the
         motor - encoder - connector - cable - DSP connection chain
         occurred. 

       Remedy:
         Check the encoder connection and if necessary replace the encoder
         cable. If the problem continues, replace the DSP board. 


61964  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP Temp of power module
       above maximum threshold (sts 0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware error (<param> = stsHW).
         This is signalled when the temperature of the power module passes
         over the set alarm threshold. 

       Remedy:
         Check the serviceability of the rear fans and the cleanliness of
         the cabinet ventilation channel. Check the mechanical clamping of
         the axes module on the dissipater. 


61965  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> Temp of motor above
       maximum threshold 

       Cause:
         The motor temperature is over the maximum limit. Probably the
         connection to the motor is open. There is an interruption on one or
         more of the motor phases. The axis moves with the motor braked.
         There is usually a message that informs the user on the high
         current request from the motor. Check that the arm cycle does not
         put the motors under stress. 

       Remedy:
         Check the connections. Check that the connection to the brake is
         not open. Examine the sequence of previous alarms paying special
         attention to those with "high current request". Check the
         serviceability of the motor in the open phase. If necessary replace
         the DSP board.

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a software error ; this error is
         specified by the loop through a range of bits. Check the bit
         values. If bit 3 is 0, see the description of error 62010 (DSP
         Encoder not initialised); if bit 6 is 0, see the description of
         error 62009 (DSP axis not configured); if bit 13 is 0, see error
         62011 (DSP not initialised); if bit 14 is 0, see error 62012 (DSP
         external synchronism failed); if bit 15 is 0,see error 62013 (DSP

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware warning (<param> = stsHW).
         This indicates a fault in the internal operation of the sinusoidal
         encoder. The alarm indication results from the acquisition of the
         encoder internal status by the relevant read command. 

       Remedy:
         The system is deteriorating in the encoder read serviceability .
         Check the motor - encoder - connector - cable - DSP chain. 


61976  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP power module

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware warning (<param> = stsHW).
         This is shown when the power module temperature exceeds the set
         warning threshold. 

       Remedy:
         Check the serviceability of the rear fans and the cleanliness of
         the cabinet ventilation channel. Check the mechanical clamping of
         the axis module on the dissipater. 


61977  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP motor temperature above

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware warning (<param> = stsHW).
         This is shown when the motor temperature exceeds the set alarm
         threshold. 

       Remedy:
         Check the connections and the connection to the brake , which must
         not be open. Examine the sequence of previous alarms, especially
         those for "high current request". Check the serviceability of the
         motor in open phase. 


61978  14-FATAL Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP Fault on Hiperface

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware warning (<param> = stsHW).
         There is an error on the Hiperface serial line used to read the
         encoder. 

       Remedy:
         The system is deteriorating in the encoder read serviceability
         Check the motor - encoder - connector - cable - DSP chain. 


61979  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP Fault on sinusoidal

         There is an error on the Hiperface serial line used to read the
         encoder. 

       Remedy:
         The system is deteriorating in the encoder read serviceability.
         Check the motor- encoder - connector - cable - DSP chain. 


61980  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP Warning brake command
       circuit (sts 0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware warning (<param> = stsHW).
         It indicates the true state of the brake circuit and this
         information is passed through the DSP and the CPU board. If the
         system has the drives switched to on, the brake is always powered
         on, therefore the value of the bit which causes this error is
         always set to 1. 

       Remedy:
         This is just an informational message. 


61981  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP Warning incorrect drive
       full scale current value (sts 0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware warning (<param> = stsHW).
         The full scale current is wrong. There is an inconsistency between
         the declared current value in the characterisation file and the
         size of the drive power module . 

       Remedy:
         Check the size of the drive power module. Replace the power module
         is the size and the declaration are correct. 


61982  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> I2T triggered 

       Cause:
         The robot work cycle is stressing the axis motor and the axis is
         moving when the motor is braked. The current value the motor
         requests from the control is high. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the declarations regarding the load are correct and that
         the connection to the brake is not open. 


61983  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP encoder correction
       algorithm triggered (sts 0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         The current loop (DSP) shows a hardware warning (<param> = stsHW).
         The compensation algorithm which rebuilds the encoder reading has
         run. The position value obtained counting the encoder impulses from
         the  DSP offsets more than one  mechanical degree from the position
         absolute value read by the encoder via serial line. The DSP
         attempts to recover from  the error. 

       Remedy:
         A continuous signalling indicates that the circuit linked to the
         encoder reading is being  damaged.  Check the following chain:
         motor - encoder - connector - cable - DSP.

61991  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> following error out of
       range 

       Cause:
         The servo control is not able to keep the following error within a
         certain limit. This is because of a limited value problem of the
         currents coming from the servo drive or the state of the brake
         (braked axis). 

       Remedy:
         Analyse the maximum current value and make sure that it is
         sufficient to move the axes at maximum speed. Make sure also that
         the axes are not on the limit switch. Check that the brakes are not
         locked and that the connection to the brake is not open. Check that
         the robot is not overloaded.

61999  11-DRIVE OFF Arm: <servo_num> Robot Alarm 

       Cause:
         The Robot Alarm input (AllarmeRobot) is active during a DRIVE ON
         request. The drive deactivates. This means that the alarms cable
         coming from the robot is open; usually this input is used by a
         device to signal any malfunctions to the robot control. 

       Remedy:
         Check the external device connected to this alarm input or check
         the by-pass of the robot connectors or the control. 


62000  11-DRIVE OFF Arm: <servo_num> Air alarm 

       Cause:
         The input for the Air Alarm (AllarmeAria) is active during a DRIVE
         ON request; the drive deactivates. This means that the air pressure
         is not sufficient for the device 

       Remedy:
         Check the air supply and check if the robot actually needs air.

62006  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> motion under no servo
       control 

       Cause:
         The servo control continues to perceive movement of a position
         transducer even if the servo loops are open. In other words, the
         transducers are moving and the servo control is not sending current
         to the motors. This could be caused by disturbance on the
         transducer reading or by the brakes that are unable to prevent
         movement of the motor. 

       Remedy:
         Check the transducer connections and inspect the axis brakes. 


62007  2-WARNING Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> <type> high current
       required (<param>) 

       Cause:
         The servo control requests too much current to the motors. This may
         be because the robot cycle is too severe or because there are
         problems on the motor itself, such as a wrong phase or a closed
         brake. 

       Remedy:
         Check that the processing is executed in a satisfactory manner. If
         it is, ignore this message. Otherwise the cycle has to be changed,
         modulating the acceleration and deceleration movements where the
         error takes place, or trying to optimise the spots in the area
         involved to reduce stress on the robot. Check that the connection
         to the brake is not open. 


62008  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> mismatch in brakes
       status 

       Cause:
         The brake control status is not consistent to the signals that
         concern the brake. 

       Remedy:
         Check the brake serviceability. Connections, wiring, motor power
         supply voltage.

62010  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP Encoder uninit (sts
       0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         The encoder initialising, with timer QEP and initial absolute
         position has not been executed. 

       Remedy:
         Check the encoder cable and the connection to the motor; if the
         problem persists replace the motor. 


62011  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP uninit (sts
       0x<param>) 

       Cause:
         The DSP board initialising has not taken place (the default values
         have not been set). 

       Remedy:
         Change the DSP board. 


62012  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> DSP external synchronism

       Cause:
         There has been no synchronising with the external 8KHZ synchronism
         signal . 

       Remedy:
         Check the condition of the synchronism signal connection. Replace
         the DSP board.

62015  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> <type> speed out of
       limits 

       Cause:
         Servo control cannot maintain the velocity error (difference
         between the target speed and the real speed) under a certain limit.
         This can be due either to a limited value of currents coming from
         the servo drive or to the state of the brake (axis refrained). 

       Remedy:
         Verify that the maximum value of the current can move the axes at
         maximum speed. Check that the axes are not at the stroke end.
         Verify that brakes are not blocked and that the connector to the
         brake is not open. Check that the robot is not overloaded.

       Cause:
         In DRIVE ON state, the additional fan, dedicated to the cooling of
         the motor, is not active or is not working. 

       Remedy:
         Please check the connections, the cables, the supply voltage

62024  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> persistent high current 

       Cause:
         The current required for the axis persists for more than 500
         milliseconds. 

       Remedy:
         The cycle time is not acceptable or the axis characterization is
         not correct; please check the size-motor-drive association. 


62025  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> <type> CRCOPEN

       Cause:
         The test on targets addressed to the C5G controller failed. The

       Remedy:
         Please check the target generator on the PC/CRCOPEN controller. 


62028  11-DRIVE OFF PowerLink AMS-PPS (<board>) module in OFF 

       Cause:
         The PowerLink AMS-PassivePowerSupply (Module ID="SL1.IF2.ST<
         board>") module entered the OFF state (yellow led is switched off).
         The system will automatically try to switch the module ON upon next
         DRIVE ON. 

       Remedy:

         is not working. 

       Remedy:
         Please check the connections, the cables, the supply voltage

62469  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> tolerance unobtainable 

       Cause:
         The arm is not able to enter the joint tolerance with those
         programmable parameters. 

       Remedy:
         Change the setting of $TERM_TYPE from FINE to COARSE if it is
         possible for the application, or increase the tolerance range
         ($TOL_JNT[][axis]) and switch the controller off and on. If the
         cycle is now executed correctly, save the new predefined variable
         in .C5G, or increase the time ($TOL_TOUT) but this increases the
         cycle time. 


62470  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> position out of tolerance 

       Cause:
         The arm is not able to enter into a sphere with those programmable
         parameters. 

       Remedy:
         The radius of the sphere is too small. It is possible to increase
         it changing $TOL_FINE. If it is possible for the particular
         application, the problem could be solved by changing the setting of
         $TERM_TYPE from FINE to COARSE or it is possible to increase the
         time ($TOL_TOUT) but this increases the cycle time. 


62471  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> HOLD due to singularity 

       Cause:
         If the predefined variable $SING_CARE is set TRUE or Sensor
         Tracking is enabled, the controller indicates to the user that the
         position of the robot is near to a singularity. 

       Remedy:
         If the predefined variable is set FALSE, the controller tries to
         reach the singularities by limiting the joints speed; this is
         possible only for some kind of robots. If Sensor Tracking is
         enabled it is not possible to avoid this situation and the user
         should move the robot out of the singularity. 


62472  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> HOLD Cartesian limit + 

       Cause:
         The arm is near the positive limit of the available range for an
         axis. It is not possible to move the arm further or the arm cannot
         reach the position due to its kinematics. 

       Remedy:
         Change the final position. 


62473  8-HOLD Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> HOLD Cartesian limit - 

       Cause:
         The arm is near the negative limit of the available range for an
         axis. It is not possible to move the arm further or the arm cannot
         reach the position due to its kinematics.

62477  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> Cartesian position out of range 

       Cause:
         The Cartesian position is out of the available workspace for this
         arm. 

       Remedy:
         Change the position. 


62478  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> axis 1 at undefined position 

       Cause:
         The arm, typically a SMART robot, has the center of the wrist
         aligned with the z-axis of the world frame. This is an arm
         singularity. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid entering the center of the wrist in a cylindrical volume
         coaxial to the z-axis. 


62479  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> wrist axis at undefined position 

       Cause:
         The wrist, typically a SMART wrist, has axis 5 at zero position.
         For this wrist, it is impossible to independently compute the
         values of axes 4, 5, and 6. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid working in Cartesian space with axis 5 at zero position or,
         if implemented, change the setting of $ORNT_TYPE to WRIST_JNT in
         order to execute the trajectory in Cartesian, but interpolate the
         wrist axes in joint. 


62480  2-WARNING Arm <arm_num> axis 2/3 at open stroke end 

       Cause:
         The arm is a robot with the same kinematics for axes 2 and 3. Due
         to the parallelogram it is not possible to move axis 2 and axis 3
         independently. For the reciprocal joint position they are at the
         maximum open configuration. 

       Remedy:
         Reenter the available workspace of the robot. 


62481  2-WARNING Arm <arm_num> axis 2/3 at closed stroke end 

       Cause:
         The arm is a robot with the same kinematics for axes 2 and 3. Due
         to the parallelogram it is not possible to move axis 2 and axis 3
         independently. For the reciprocal joint position they are at the
         maximum close configuration. 

       Remedy:
         Reenter the available workspace of the robot. 


62482  10-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> tolerance HOLD
       unobtainable 

       Cause:
         It is not possible to obtain the tolerance after a HOLD. 

       Remedy:
         Please contact COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


62483  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> axis 5 at undefined position 

       Cause:
         The wrist has axis 5 at an undefined position. 

       Remedy:
         Avoid working in Cartesian space with axis 5 at this undefined
         position or, if implemented, change the setting of $ORNT_TYPE to
         WRIST_JNT in order to execute the trajectory in Cartesian, but
         interpolate the wrist axes in joint. 


62484  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> inverse kinematics not available 

       Cause:
         This machine does not have the inverse kinematics. Or, in case of
         compensation algorithm active, it means that the programmed Joint
         or Cartesian position cannot be compensated. 

       Remedy:
         Do not try to work in Cartesian. Or, in case of compensation
         algorithm active, program the Joint or Cartesian position out of
         the area where the compensation cannot work. 


62485  11-DRIVE OFF Axis <axis_num> Arm <arm_num> bad interpolator target
       position 

       Cause:
         A check of the targets in the servo control environment failed. The
         interpolator is requesting target positions too far ahead. 

       Remedy:
         Change the position if possible.  Please contact  COMAU
         (service.robotics@comau.com). 


62486  12-DRIVE OFF Arm <arm_num> ADVANCE or new jog motion not allowed 

       Cause:
         The machine has changed configuration due to a singularity. Neither
         the ADVANCE clause nor a new jog motion are allowed. 

       Remedy:
         Either avoid moving through singularity points, do not use the
         ADVANCE clause, or release all jog buttons before pressing a new
         one. 


62487  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> Seam Track parameters out of range 

       Cause:
         Some initialization parameters of the Seam Track have been set at a
         wrong value. 

       Remedy:
         Compare the value with the corresponding range. 


62488  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> Seam Track synchronisms not in sequence 

       Cause:
         Seam Track detected an error in weaving synchronism from system.
         This can happen with Cartesian weaving along very short movement
         joined in fly if $FLY_TYPE is set to FLY_NORM. 

       Remedy:
         $FLY_TYPE must be set at FLY_CART value. 


62489  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> Seam Track synchronism overrun 

       Cause:
         During arc sensor tracking with weaving there is an overlap of
         reading phases from the analogic input. This happens if weaving
         frequency is too high or if the time delay between the theoretical
         and real targets is too long. 

       Remedy:
         Check Seam Track parameters for time delay or reduce the weaving
         frequency. 


62490  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> Seam Track synchronism timeout 

       Cause:
         The weaving synchronism from the system to Seam Track do not arrive
         on time. This happens only if a time-out is programmed on Seam
         Track (usually time-out check is disabled). 

       Remedy:
         Increase the time-out or remove this feature by setting the Seam
         Track time-out to zero. 


62491  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> Seam Track corrections out of range 

       Cause:
         Seam Track has detected corrections out of the threshold for a long
         period. Usually this is due to an instability of the welding
         current or to a wrong value of the threshold. 

       Remedy:
         Check the threshold on the maximum corrections; verify the welding
         parameters and the workpiece surface conditions. 


62492  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> Seam Track board error 

       Cause:
         Seam Track has detected an internal error. 

       Remedy:
         Board could be damaged. 


62493  8-HOLD Arm <arm_num> total corrections out of range 

       Cause:
         The distance between the robot and the programmed trajectory has
         exceeded the threshold defined in $SENSOR_OFST_LIM. This is a
         safety guard to stop the robot in the case of sensor failure. 

       Remedy:
         Check the sensor or increase $SENSOR_OFST_LIM. 


62494  11-DRIVE OFF CPU <num_cpu> interpolation overrun 

       Cause:
         The interpolator sampling time is too short. 

       Remedy:
         The interpolator sampling time has to be increased. Please, contact
         COMAU (service.robotics@comau.com). 


62495  2-WARNING Arm <arm_num> axis 1 at open stroke end 

       Cause:
         The arm is near the open stroke end for axis 1. Is not possible to

       Remedy:
         Reenter the available workspace of the robot. 


62496  2-WARNING Arm <arm_num> axis 1 at closed stroke end 

       Cause:
         The arm is near the close stroke end for axis 1. Is not possible to
         move the arm further.
